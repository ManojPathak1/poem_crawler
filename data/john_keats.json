","","Soft went the music the soft air along, ","While fluent Greek a vowel&#x2019;d undersong ","Kept up among the guests discoursing low ","At first, for scarcely was the wine at flow; ","But when the happy vintage touch&#x2019;d their brains, ","Louder they talk, and louder come the strains ","Of powerful instruments:&#x2014;the gorgeous dyes, ","The space, the splendour of the draperies, ","The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer, ","Beautiful slaves, and Lamia&#x2019;s self, appear, ","Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed, ","And every soul from human trammels freed, ","No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine, ","Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine.

","","By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place, ","Scarce saw in all the room another face, ","Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took ","Full brimm&#x2019;d, and opposite sent forth a look ","&#x2019;Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance ","From his old teacher&#x2019;s wrinkled countenance, ","And pledge him. The bald-head philosopher ","Had fix&#x2019;d his eye, without a twinkle or stir ","Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride, ","Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride. ","Lycius then press&#x2019;d her hand, with devout touch, ","As pale it lay upon the rosy couch: ","&#x2019;Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins; ","Then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains ","Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart. ","&#x201C;Lamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start? ","&#x201C;Know&#x2019;st thou that man?&#x201D; Poor Lamia answer&#x2019;d not. ","He gaz&#x2019;d into her eyes, and not a jot ","Own&#x2019;d they the lovelorn piteous appeal: ","More, more he gaz&#x2019;d: his human senses reel: ","Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs; ","There was no recognition in those orbs. ","&#x201C;Lamia!&#x201D; he cried&#x2014;and no soft-toned reply. ","The many heard, and the loud revelry ","Grew hush; the stately music no more breathes; ","The myrtle sicken&#x2019;d in a thousand wreaths. ","By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased; ","A deadly silence step by step increased, ","Until it seem&#x2019;d a horrid presence there, ","And not a man but felt the terror in his hair. ","&#x201C;Lamia!&#x201D; he shriek&#x2019;d; and nothing but the shriek ","With its sad echo did the silence break. ","&#x201C;Begone, foul dream!&#x201D; he cried, gazing again ","In the bride&#x2019;s face, where now no azure vein ","Wander&#x2019;d on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom ","Misted the cheek; no passion to illume ","The deep-recessed vision:&#x2014;all was blight; ","Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white. ","&#x201C;Shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man! ","&#x201C;Turn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban ","&#x201C;Of all the Gods, whose dreadful images ","&#x201C;Here represent their shadowy presences, ","&#x201C;May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn ","&#x201C;Of painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn, ","&#x201C;In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright ","&#x201C;Of conscience, for their long offended might, ","&#x201C;For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries, ","&#x201C;Unlawful magic, and enticing lies. ","&#x201C;Corinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch! ","&#x201C;Mark how, possess&#x2019;d, his lashless eyelids stretch ","&#x201C;Around his demon eyes! Corinthians, see! ","&#x201C;My sweet bride withers at their potency.&#x201D; ","&#x201C;Fool!&#x201D; said the sophist, in an under-tone ","Gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan ","From Lycius answer&#x2019;d, as heart-struck and lost, ","He sank supine beside the aching ghost.

","&#x201C;A Serpent!&#x201D; echoed he; no sooner said, ","Than with a frightful scream she vanished: ","And Lycius&#x2019; arms were empty of delight, ","As were his limbs of life, from that same night.

","Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont, ","And in those meads where sometime she might haunt, ","Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse, ","Though Fancy&#x2019;s casket were unlock&#x2019;d to choose. ","Ah, what a world of love was at her feet! ","So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat ","Burnt from his winged heels to either ear, ","That from a whiteness, as the lily clear, ","Blush&#x2019;d into roses &#x2019;mid his golden hair, ","Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare. ","From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew, ","Breathing upon the flowers his passion new, ","And wound with many a river to its head, ","To find where this sweet nymph prepar&#x2019;d her secret bed: ","In vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found, ","And so he rested, on the lonely ground, ","Pensive, and full of painful jealousies ","Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees. ","There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice, ","Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys ","All pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake: ","&#x201C;When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake! ","&#x201C;When move in a sweet body fit for life, ","&#x201C;And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife ","&#x201C;Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!&#x201D; ","The God, dove-footed, glided silently ","Round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed, ","The taller grasses and full-flowering weed, ","Until he found a palpitating snake, ","Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake. ","","She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue, ","Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue; ","Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard, ","Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr&#x2019;d; ","And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed, ","Dissolv&#x2019;d, or brighter shone, or interwreathed ","Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries&#x2014; ","So rainbow-sided, touch&#x2019;d with miseries, ","She seem&#x2019;d, at once, some penanced lady elf, ","Some demon&#x2019;s mistress, or the demon&#x2019;s self. ","Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire ","Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne&#x2019;s tiar: ","Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet! ","She had a woman&#x2019;s mouth with all its pearls complete: ","And for her eyes: what could such eyes do there ","But weep, and weep, that they were born so fair? ","As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air. ","Her throat was serpent, but the words she spake ","Came, as through bubbling honey, for Love&#x2019;s sake, ","And thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay, ","Like a stoop&#x2019;d falcon ere he takes his prey. ","","&#x201C;Fair Hermes, crown&#x2019;d with feathers, fluttering light, ","&#x201C;I had a splendid dream of thee last night: ","&#x201C;I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold, ","&#x201C;Among the Gods, upon Olympus old, ","&#x201C;The only sad one; for thou didst not hear ","&#x201C;The soft, lute-finger&#x2019;d Muses chaunting clear, ","&#x201C;Nor even Apollo when he sang alone, ","&#x201C;Deaf to his throbbing throat&#x2019;s long, long melodious moan. ","&#x201C;I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes, ","&#x201C;Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks, ","&#x201C;And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart, ","&#x201C;Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art! ","&#x201C;Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?&#x201D; ","Whereat the star of Lethe not delay&#x2019;d ","His rosy eloquence, and thus inquired: ","&#x201C;Thou smooth-lipp&#x2019;d serpent, surely high inspired! ","&#x201C;Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes, ","&#x201C;Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise, ","&#x201C;Telling me only where my nymph is fled,&#x2014; ","&#x201C;Where she doth breathe!&#x201D; &#x201C;Bright planet, thou hast said,&#x201D; ","Return&#x2019;d the snake, &#x201C;but seal with oaths, fair God!&#x201D; ","&#x201C;I swear,&#x201D; said Hermes, &#x201C;by my serpent rod, ","&#x201C;And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!&#x201D; ","Light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown. ","Then thus again the brilliance feminine: ","&#x201C;Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine, ","&#x201C;Free as the air, invisibly, she strays ","&#x201C;About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days ","&#x201C;She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet ","&#x201C;Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet; ","&#x201C;From weary tendrils, and bow&#x2019;d branches green, ","&#x201C;She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen: ","&#x201C;And by my power is her beauty veil&#x2019;d ","&#x201C;To keep it unaffronted, unassail&#x2019;d ","&#x201C;By the love-glances of unlovely eyes, ","&#x201C;Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear&#x2019;d Silenus&#x2019; sighs. ","&#x201C;Pale grew her immortality, for woe ","&#x201C;Of all these lovers, and she grieved so ","&#x201C;I took compassion on her, bade her steep ","&#x201C;Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep ","&#x201C;Her loveliness invisible, yet free ","&#x201C;To wander as she loves, in liberty. ","&#x201C;Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone, ","&#x201C;If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!&#x201D; ","Then, once again, the charmed God began ","An oath, and through the serpent&#x2019;s ears it ran ","Warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian. ","Ravish&#x2019;d, she lifted her Circean head, ","Blush&#x2019;d a live damask, and swift-lisping said, ","&#x201C;I was a woman, let me have once more ","&#x201C;A woman&#x2019;s shape, and charming as before. ","&#x201C;I love a youth of Corinth&#x2014;O the bliss! ","&#x201C;Give me my woman&#x2019;s form, and place me where he is. ","&#x201C;Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow, ","&#x201C;And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now.&#x201D; ","The God on half-shut feathers sank serene, ","She breath&#x2019;d upon his eyes, and swift was seen ","Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green. ","It was no dream; or say a dream it was, ","Real are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass ","Their pleasures in a long immortal dream. ","One warm, flush&#x2019;d moment, hovering, it might seem ","Dash&#x2019;d by the wood-nymph&#x2019;s beauty, so he burn&#x2019;d; ","Then, lighting on the printless verdure, turn&#x2019;d ","To the swoon&#x2019;d serpent, and with languid arm, ","Delicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm. ","So done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent, ","Full of adoring tears and blandishment, ","And towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane, ","Faded before him, cower&#x2019;d, nor could restrain ","Her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower ","That faints into itself at evening hour: ","But the God fostering her chilled hand, ","She felt the warmth, her eyelids open&#x2019;d bland, ","And, like new flowers at morning song of bees, ","Bloom&#x2019;d, and gave up her honey to the lees. ","Into the green-recessed woods they flew; ","Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do. ","","Left to herself, the serpent now began ","To change; her elfin blood in madness ran, ","Her mouth foam&#x2019;d, and the grass, therewith besprent, ","Wither&#x2019;d at dew so sweet and virulent; ","Her eyes in torture fix&#x2019;d, and anguish drear, ","Hot, glaz&#x2019;d, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear, ","Flash&#x2019;d phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear. ","The colours all inflam&#x2019;d throughout her train, ","She writh&#x2019;d about, convuls&#x2019;d with scarlet pain: ","A deep volcanian yellow took the place ","Of all her milder-mooned body&#x2019;s grace; ","And, as the lava ravishes the mead, ","Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede; ","Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars, ","Eclips&#x2019;d her crescents, and lick&#x2019;d up her stars: ","So that, in moments few, she was undrest ","Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst, ","And rubious-argent: of all these bereft, ","Nothing but pain and ugliness were left. ","Still shone her crown; that vanish&#x2019;d, also she ","Melted and disappear&#x2019;d as suddenly; ","And in the air, her new voice luting soft, ","Cried, &#x201C;Lycius! gentle Lycius!&#x201D;&#x2014;Borne aloft ","With the bright mists about the mountains hoar ","These words dissolv&#x2019;d: Crete&#x2019;s forests heard no more. ","","Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright, ","A full-born beauty new and exquisite? ","She fled into that valley they pass o&#x2019;er ","Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas&#x2019; shore; ","And rested at the foot of those wild hills, ","The rugged founts of the Peraean rills, ","And of that other ridge whose barren back ","Stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack, ","South-westward to Cleone. There she stood ","About a young bird&#x2019;s flutter from a wood, ","Fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread, ","By a clear pool, wherein she passioned ","To see herself escap&#x2019;d from so sore ills, ","While her robes flaunted with the daffodils. ","","Ah, happy Lycius!&#x2014;for she was a maid ","More beautiful than ever twisted braid, ","Or sigh&#x2019;d, or blush&#x2019;d, or on spring-flowered lea ","Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy: ","A virgin purest lipp&#x2019;d, yet in the lore ","Of love deep learned to the red heart&#x2019;s core: ","Not one hour old, yet of sciential brain ","To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain; ","Define their pettish limits, and estrange ","Their points of contact, and swift counterchange; ","Intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart ","Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art; ","As though in Cupid&#x2019;s college she had spent ","Sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent, ","And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment. ","","Why this fair creature chose so fairily ","By the wayside to linger, we shall see; ","But first &#x2019;tis fit to tell how she could muse ","And dream, when in the serpent prison-house, ","Of all she list, strange or magnificent: ","How, ever, where she will&#x2019;d, her spirit went; ","Whether to faint Elysium, or where ","Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair ","Wind into Thetis&#x2019; bower by many a pearly stair; ","Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine, ","Stretch&#x2019;d out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine; ","Or where in Pluto&#x2019;s gardens palatine ","Mulciber&#x2019;s columns gleam in far piazzian line. ","And sometimes into cities she would send ","Her dream, with feast and rioting to blend; ","And once, while among mortals dreaming thus, ","She saw the young Corinthian Lycius ","Charioting foremost in the envious race, ","Like a young Jove with calm uneager face, ","And fell into a swooning love of him. ","Now on the moth-time of that evening dim ","He would return that way, as well she knew, ","To Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew ","The eastern soft wind, and his galley now ","Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow ","In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle ","Fresh anchor&#x2019;d; whither he had been awhile ","To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there ","Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare. ","Jove heard his vows, and better&#x2019;d his desire; ","For by some freakful chance he made retire ","From his companions, and set forth to walk, ","Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk: ","Over the solitary hills he fared, ","Thoughtless at first, but ere eve&#x2019;s star appeared ","His phantasy was lost, where reason fades, ","In the calm&#x2019;d twilight of Platonic shades. ","Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near&#x2014; ","Close to her passing, in indifference drear, ","His silent sandals swept the mossy green; ","So neighbour&#x2019;d to him, and yet so unseen ","She stood: he pass&#x2019;d, shut up in mysteries, ","His mind wrapp&#x2019;d like his mantle, while her eyes ","Follow&#x2019;d his steps, and her neck regal white ","Turn&#x2019;d&#x2014;syllabling thus, &#x201C;Ah, Lycius bright, ","&#x201C;And will you leave me on the hills alone? ","&#x201C;Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown.&#x201D; ","He did; not with cold wonder fearingly, ","But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice; ","For so delicious were the words she sung, ","It seem&#x2019;d he had lov&#x2019;d them a whole summer long: ","And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up, ","Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup, ","And still the cup was full,&#x2014;while he afraid ","Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid ","Due adoration, thus began to adore; ","Her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure: ","&#x201C;Leave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess, see ","&#x201C;Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee! ","&#x201C;For pity do not this sad heart belie&#x2014; ","&#x201C;Even as thou vanishest so I shall die.

","&#x201C;To thy far wishes will thy streams obey: ","&#x201C;Stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain, ","&#x201C;Alone they can drink up the morning rain: ","&#x201C;Though a descended Pleiad, will not one ","&#x201C;Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune ","&#x201C;Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine? ","&#x201C;So sweetly to these ravish&#x2019;d ears of mine ","&#x201C;Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade ","&#x201C;Thy memory will waste me to a shade:&#x2014; ","&#x201C;For pity do not melt!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;If I should stay,&#x201D; ","Said Lamia, &#x201C;here, upon this floor of clay, ","&#x201C;And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough, ","&#x201C;What canst thou say or do of charm enough ","&#x201C;To dull the nice remembrance of my home? ","&#x201C;Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam ","&#x201C;Over these hills and vales, where no joy is,&#x2014; ","&#x201C;Empty of immortality and bliss! ","&#x201C;Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know ","&#x201C;That finer spirits cannot breathe below ","&#x201C;In human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth, ","&#x201C;What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe ","&#x201C;My essence? What serener palaces, ","&#x201C;Where I may all my many senses please, ","&#x201C;And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease? ","&#x201C;It cannot be&#x2014;Adieu!&#x201D; So said, she rose ","Tiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose ","The amorous promise of her lone complain, ","Swoon&#x2019;d, murmuring of love, and pale with pain. ","The cruel lady, without any show ","Of sorrow for her tender favourite&#x2019;s woe, ","But rather, if her eyes could brighter be, ","With brighter eyes and slow amenity, ","Put her new lips to his, and gave afresh ","The life she had so tangled in her mesh: ","And as he from one trance was wakening ","Into another, she began to sing, ","Happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing, ","A song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres, ","While, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires ","And then she whisper&#x2019;d in such trembling tone, ","As those who, safe together met alone ","For the first time through many anguish&#x2019;d days, ","Use other speech than looks; bidding him raise ","His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt, ","For that she was a woman, and without ","Any more subtle fluid in her veins ","Than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains ","Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his. ","And next she wonder&#x2019;d how his eyes could miss ","Her face so long in Corinth, where, she said, ","She dwelt but half retir&#x2019;d, and there had led ","Days happy as the gold coin could invent ","Without the aid of love; yet in content ","Till she saw him, as once she pass&#x2019;d him by, ","Where &#x2019;gainst a column he leant thoughtfully ","At Venus&#x2019; temple porch, &#x2019;mid baskets heap&#x2019;d ","Of amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap&#x2019;d ","Late on that eve, as &#x2019;twas the night before ","The Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more, ","But wept alone those days, for why should she adore? ","Lycius from death awoke into amaze, ","To see her still, and singing so sweet lays; ","Then from amaze into delight he fell ","To hear her whisper woman&#x2019;s lore so well; ","And every word she spake entic&#x2019;d him on ","To unperplex&#x2019;d delight and pleasure known. ","Let the mad poets say whate&#x2019;er they please ","Of the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses, ","There is not such a treat among them all, ","Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall, ","As a real woman, lineal indeed ","From Pyrrha&#x2019;s pebbles or old Adam&#x2019;s seed. ","Thus gentle Lamia judg&#x2019;d, and judg&#x2019;d aright, ","That Lycius could not love in half a fright, ","So threw the goddess off, and won his heart ","More pleasantly by playing woman&#x2019;s part, ","With no more awe than what her beauty gave, ","That, while it smote, still guaranteed to save. ","Lycius to all made eloquent reply, ","Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh; ","And last, pointing to Corinth, ask&#x2019;d her sweet, ","If &#x2019;twas too far that night for her soft feet. ","The way was short, for Lamia&#x2019;s eagerness ","Made, by a spell, the triple league decrease ","To a few paces; not at all surmised ","By blinded Lycius, so in her comprized. ","They pass&#x2019;d the city gates, he knew not how ","So noiseless, and he never thought to know. ","","As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all, ","Throughout her palaces imperial, ","And all her populous streets and temples lewd, ","Mutter&#x2019;d, like tempest in the distance brew&#x2019;d, ","To the wide-spreaded night above her towers. ","Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours, ","Shuffled their sandals o&#x2019;er the pavement white, ","Companion&#x2019;d or alone; while many a light ","Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals, ","And threw their moving shadows on the walls, ","Or found them cluster&#x2019;d in the corniced shade ","Of some arch&#x2019;d temple door, or dusky colonnade. ","","Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear, ","Her fingers he press&#x2019;d hard, as one came near ","With curl&#x2019;d gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown, ","Slow-stepp&#x2019;d, and robed in philosophic gown: ","Lycius shrank closer, as they met and past, ","Into his mantle, adding wings to haste, ","While hurried Lamia trembled: &#x201C;Ah,&#x201D; said he, ","&#x201C;Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully? ","&#x201C;Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew?&#x201D;&#x2014; ","&#x201C;I&#x2019;m wearied,&#x201D; said fair Lamia: &#x201C;tell me who ","&#x201C;Is that old man? I cannot bring to mind ","&#x201C;His features:&#x2014;Lycius! wherefore did you blind ","&#x201C;Yourself from his quick eyes?&#x201D; Lycius replied, ","&#x201C;&#x2019;Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide ","&#x201C;And good instructor; but to-night he seems ","&#x201C;The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams. ","","While yet he spake they had arrived before ","A pillar&apos;d porch, with lofty portal door, ","Where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow ","Reflected in the slabbed steps below, ","Mild as a star in water; for so new, ","And so unsullied was the marble hue, ","So through the crystal polish, liquid fine, ","Ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine ","Could e&apos;er have touch&apos;d there. Sounds Aeolian ","Breath&apos;d from the hinges, as the ample span ","Of the wide doors disclos&apos;d a place unknown ","Some time to any, but those two alone, ","And a few Persian mutes, who that same year ","Were seen about the markets: none knew where ","They could inhabit; the most curious ","Were foil&apos;d, who watch&apos;d to trace them to their house: ","And but the flitter-winged verse must tell, ","For truth&apos;s sake, what woe afterwards befel, ","&apos;Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus, ","Shut from the busy world of more incredulous. \n                        ","\n                    "],["\n                        And what is love?

","Fools! if some passions high have warm&apos;d the world, ","If Queens and Soldiers have play&apos;d deep for hearts, ","It is no reason why such agonies ","Should be more common than the growth of weeds. ","Fools! make me whole again that weighty pearl ","The Queen of Egypt melted, and I&apos;ll say ","That ye may love in spite of beaver hats. \n                        ","\n                    "],["\n                        This pleasant tale is like a little copse:","The honied lines so freshly interlace,","To keep the reader in so sweet a place,","So that he here and there full-hearted stops;","And oftentimes he feels the dewy drops","Come cool and suddenly against his face,","And, by the wandering melody, may trace","Which way the tender-legged linnet hops.","Oh! what a power has white Simplicity!","What mighty power has this gentle story!","I, that do ever feel athirst for glory,","Could at this moment be content to lie","Meekly upon the grass, as those whose sobbings","Were heard of none beside the mournful robins. \n                        ","\n                    "],["\n                        I stood tip-toe upon a little hill, ","The air was cooling, and so very still, ","That the sweet buds which with a modest pride ","Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside, ","Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems, ","Had not yet lost those starry diadems ","Caught from the early sobbing of the morn. ","The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn, ","And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept ","On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept ","A little noiseless noise among the leaves, ","Born of the very sigh that silence heaves: ","For not the faintest motion could be seen ","Of all the shades that slanted o&#x2019;er the green. ","There was wide wand&#x2019;ring for the greediest eye, ","To peer about upon variety; ","Far round the horizon&#x2019;s crystal air to skim, ","And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim; ","To picture out the quaint, and curious bending ","Of a fresh woodland alley, never ending; ","Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves, ","Guess where the jaunty streams refresh themselves. ","I gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free ","As though the fanning wings of Mercury ","Had played upon my heels: I was light-hearted, ","And many pleasures to my vision started; ","So I straightway began to pluck a posey ","Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy. ","","A bush of May flowers with the bees about them; ","Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them; ","And let a lush laburnum oversweep them, ","And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them ","Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets, ","That they may bind the moss in leafy nets. ","","A filbert hedge with wildbriar overtwined, ","And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind ","Upon their summer thrones; there too should be ","The frequent chequer of a youngling tree, ","That with a score of light green breth[r]en shoots ","From the quaint mossiness of aged roots: ","Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters ","Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters ","The spreading blue bells: it may haply mourn ","That such fair clusters should be rudely torn ","From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly ","By infant hands, left on the path to die. ","","Open afresh your round of starry folds, ","Ye ardent marigolds! ","Dry up the moisture from your golden lids, ","For great Apollo bids ","That in these days your praises should be sung ","On many harps, which he has lately strung; ","And when again your dewiness he kisses, ","Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses: ","So haply when I rove in some far vale, ","His mighty voice may come upon the gale. ","","Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight: ","With wings of gentle flush o&#x2019;er delicate white, ","And taper fingers catching at all things, ","To bind them all about with tiny rings. ","","Linger awhile upon some bending planks ","That lean against a streamlet&#x2019;s rushy banks, ","And watch intently Nature&#x2019;s gentle doings: ","They will be found softer than ring-dove&#x2019;s cooings. ","How silent comes the water round that bend; ","Not the minutest whisper does it send ","To the o&#x2019;erhanging sallows: blades of grass ","Slowly across the chequer&#x2019;d shadows pass. ","Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach ","To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach ","A natural sermon o&#x2019;er their pebbly beds; ","Where swarms of minnows show their little heads, ","Staying their wavy bodies &#x2019;gainst the streams, ","To taste the luxury of sunny beams ","Temper&#x2019;d with coolness. How they ever wrestle ","With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle ","Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand. ","If you but scantily hold out the hand, ","That very instant not one will remain; ","But turn your eye, and they are there again. ","The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses, ","And cool themselves among the em&#x2019;rald tresses; ","The while they cool themselves, they freshness give, ","And moisture, that the bowery green may live: ","So keeping up an interchange of favours, ","Like good men in the truth of their behaviours. ","Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop ","From low hung branches; little space they stop; ","But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek; ","Then off at once, as in a wanton freak: ","Or perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings ","Pausing upon their yellow flutterings. ","Were I in such a place, I sure should pray ","That nought less sweet, might call my thoughts away, ","Than the soft rustle of a maiden&#x2019;s gown ","Fanning away the dandelion&#x2019;s down; ","Than the light music of her nimble toes ","Patting against the sorrel as she goes. ","How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught ","Playing in all her innocence of thought. ","O let me lead her gently o&#x2019;er the brook, ","Watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look; ","O let me for one moment touch her wrist; ","Let me one moment to her breathing list; ","And as she leaves me may she often turn ","Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne. ","What next? A tuft of evening primroses, ","O&#x2019;er which the mind may hover till it dozes; ","O&#x2019;er which it well might take a pleasant sleep, ","But that &#x2019;tis ever startled by the leap ","Of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting ","Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting; ","Or by the moon lifting her silver rim ","Above a cloud, and with a gradual swim ","Coming into the blue with all her light. ","O Maker of sweet poets, dear delight ","Of this fair world, and all its gentle livers; ","Spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers, ","Mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams, ","Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams, ","Lover of loneliness, and wandering, ","Of upcast eye, and tender pondering! ","Thee must I praise above all other glories ","That smile us on to tell delightful stories. ","For what has made the sage or poet write ","But the fair paradise of Nature&#x2019;s light? ","In the calm grandeur of a sober line, ","We see the waving of the mountain pine; ","And when a tale is beautifully staid, ","We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade: ","When it is moving on luxurious wings, ","The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings: ","Fair dewy roses brush against our faces, ","And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases; ","O&#x2019;erhead we see the jasmine and sweet briar, ","And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire; ","While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles ","Charms us at once away from all our troubles: ","So that we feel uplifted from the world, ","Walking upon the white clouds wreath&#x2019;d and curl&#x2019;d. ","So felt he, who first told, how Psyche went ","On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment; ","What Psyche felt, and Love, when their full lips ","First touch&#x2019;d; what amorous and fondling nips ","They gave each other&#x2019;s cheeks; with all their sighs, ","And how they kist each other&#x2019;s tremulous eyes: ","The silver lamp,&#x2014;the ravishment,&#x2014;the wonder&#x2014; ","The darkness,&#x2014;loneliness,&#x2014;the fearful thunder; ","Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown, ","To bow for gratitude before Jove&#x2019;s throne. ","","So did he feel, who pull&#x2019;d the boughs aside, ","That we might look into a forest wide, ","To catch a glimpse of Fawns, and Dryades ","Coming with softest rustle through the trees; ","And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet, ","Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet: ","Telling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled ","Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread. ","Poor Nymph,&#x2014;poor Pan,&#x2014;how did he weep to find, ","Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind ","Along the reedy stream; a half heard strain, ","Full of sweet desolation&#x2014;balmy pain. ","","What first inspired a bard of old to sing ","Narcissus pining o&#x2019;er the untainted spring? ","In some delicious ramble, he had found ","A little space, with boughs all woven round; ","And in the midst of all, a clearer pool ","Than e&#x2019;er reflected in its pleasant cool, ","The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping ","Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping. ","And on the bank a lonely flower he spied, ","A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride, ","Drooping its beauty o&#x2019;er the watery clearness, ","To woo its own sad image into nearness: ","Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move; ","But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love. ","So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot, ","Some fainter gleamings o&#x2019;er his fancy shot; ","Nor was it long ere he had told the tale ","Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo&#x2019;s bale. ","","Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew ","That sweetest of all songs, that ever new, ","That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness, ","Coming ever to bless ","The wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing ","Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing ","From out the middle air, from flowery nests, ","And from the pillowy silkiness that rests ","Full in the speculation of the stars. ","Ah! surely he had burst our mortal bars; ","Into some wond&#x2019;rous region he had gone, ","To search for thee, divine Endymion! ","","He was a Poet, sure a lover too, ","Who stood on Latmus&#x2019; top, what time there blew ","Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below; ","And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow ","A hymn from Dian&#x2019;s temple; while upswelling, ","The incense went to her own starry dwelling. ","But though her face was clear as infant&#x2019;s eyes, ","Though she stood smiling o&#x2019;er the sacrifice, ","The Poet wept at her so piteous fate, ","Wept that such beauty should be desolate: ","So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won, ","And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion. ","","Queen of the wide air; thou most lovely queen ","Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen! ","As thou exceedest all things in thy shine, ","So every tale, does this sweet tale of thine. ","O for three words of honey, that I might ","Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night! ","","Where distant ships do seem to show their keels, ","Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels, ","And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes, ","Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize. ","The evening weather was so bright, and clear, ","That men of health were of unusual cheer; ","Stepping like Homer at the trumpet&#x2019;s call, ","Or young Apollo on the pedestal: ","And lovely women were as fair and warm, ","As Venus looking sideways in alarm. ","The breezes were ethereal, and pure, ","And crept through half closed lattices to cure ","The languid sick; it cool&#x2019;d their fever&#x2019;d sleep, ","And soothed them into slumbers full and deep. ","Soon they awoke clear eyed: nor burnt with thirsting ","Nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting: ","And springing up, they met the wond&#x2019;ring sight ","Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight; ","Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare, ","And on their placid foreheads part the hair. ","Young men, and maidens at each other gaz&#x2019;d ","With hands held back, and motionless, amaz&#x2019;d ","To see the brightness in each others&#x2019; eyes; ","And so they stood, fill&#x2019;d with a sweet surprise, ","Until their tongues were loos&#x2019;d in poesy. ","Therefore no lover did of anguish die: ","But the soft numbers, in that moment spoken, ","Made silken ties, that never may be broken. ","Cynthia! I cannot tell the greater blisses, ","That follow&#x2019;d thine, and thy dear shepherd&#x2019;s kisses: ","Was there a Poet born?&#x2014;but now no more, ","My wand&#x2019;ring spirit must no further soar. \n                        ","\n                    "],["\n                        O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute!","Fair plumed Syren! Queen of far away!","Leave melodizing on this wintry day,","Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute.","Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute","Betwixt damnation and impassioned clay","Must I burn through; once more humbly assay","The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit.","Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion,","Begetters of our deep eternal theme,","When through the old oak Forest I am gone,","Let me not wander in a barren dream,","But when I am consumed in the Fire,","Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire. \n                        ","\n                    "],["\n                        Keen, fitful gusts are whisp&apos;ring here and there ","Among the bushes half leafless, and dry; ","The stars look very cold about the sky, ","And I have many miles on foot to fare.

","He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky, ","And smiles at the far clearness all around, ","Until his heart is well nigh over wound, ","And turns for calmness to the pleasant green ","Of easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean ","So elegantly o&apos;er the waters&apos; brim ","And show their blossoms trim. ","Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow ","The freaks, and dartings of the black-wing&apos;d swallow, ","Delighting much, to see it half at rest, ","Dip so refreshingly its wings, and breast ","&apos;Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon, ","The widening circles into nothing gone. ","","And now the sharp keel of his little boat ","Comes up with ripple, and with easy float, ","And glides into a bed of water lillies: ","Broad leav&apos;d are they and their white canopies ","Are upward turn&apos;d to catch the heavens&apos; dew. ","Near to a little island&apos;s point they grew; ","Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view ","Of this sweet spot of earth. The bowery shore ","Went off in gentle windings to the hoar ","And light blue mountains: but no breathing man ","With a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan ","Nature&apos;s clear beauty, could pass lightly by ","Objects that look&apos;d out so invitingly ","On either side. These, gentle Calidore ","Greeted, as he had known them long before. ","","The sidelong view of swelling leafiness, ","Which the glad setting sun, in gold doth dress; ","Whence ever, and anon the jay outsprings, ","And scales upon the beauty of its wings. ","","The lonely turret, shatter&apos;d, and outworn, ","Stands venerably proud; too proud to mourn ","Its long lost grandeur: fir trees grow around, ","Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground. ","","The little chapel with the cross above ","Upholding wreaths of ivy; the white dove, ","That on the windows spreads his feathers light, ","And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight. ","","Green tufted islands casting their soft shades ","Across the lake; sequester&#x2019;d leafy glades, ","That through the dimness of their twilight show ","Large dock leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow ","Of the wild cat&#x2019;s eyes, or the silvery stems ","Of delicate birch trees, or long grass which hems ","A little brook. The youth had long been viewing ","These pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing ","The mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught ","A trumpet&apos;s silver voice. Ah! it was fraught ","With many joys for him: the warder&apos;s ken ","Had found white coursers prancing in the glen: ","Friends very dear to him he soon will see; ","So pushes off his boat most eagerly, ","And soon upon the lake he skims along, ","Deaf to the nightingale&#x2019;s first under-song; ","Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly: ","His spirit flies before him so completely. ","","And now he turns a jutting point of land, ","Whence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand: ","Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches, ","Before the point of his light shallop reaches ","Those marble steps that through the water dip: ","Now over them he goes with hasty trip, ","And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors: ","Anon he leaps along the oaken floors ","Of halls and corridors. ","","Delicious sounds! those little bright-eyed things ","That float about the air on azure wings, ","Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang ","Of clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang, ","Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain, ","Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein; ","While from beneath the threat&apos;ning portcullis ","They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss, ","What gentle squeeze he gave each lady&apos;s hand! ","How tremblingly their delicate ancles spann&#x2019;d! ","Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone, ","While whisperings of affection ","Made him delay to let their tender feet ","Come to the earth; with an incline so sweet ","From their low palfreys o&apos;er his neck they bent: ","And whether there were tears of languishment, ","Or that the evening dew had pearl&apos;d their tresses, ","He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses ","With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye ","All the soft luxury ","That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand, ","Fair as some wonder out of fairy land, ","Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers ","Of whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers: ","And this he fondled with his happy cheek ","As if for joy he would no further seek; ","When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond ","Came to his ear, like something from beyond ","His present being: so he gently drew ","His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new, ","From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending, ","Thank&apos;d heaven that his joy was never ending; ","While &apos;gainst his forehead he devoutly press&apos;d ","A hand heaven made to succour the distress&apos;d; ","A hand that from the world&apos;s bleak promontory ","Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.

Behold! he walks","On heaven&apos;s pavement; brotherly he talks","To divine powers: from his hand full fain","Juno&apos;s proud birds are pecking pearly grain:","He tries the nerve of Phoebus&apos; golden bow,","And asketh where the golden apples grow:","Upon his arm he braces Pallas&apos; shield,","And strives in vain to unsettle and wield","A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings","A full-brimm&apos;d goblet, dances lightly, sings","And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,","And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,","Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.","He blows a bugle,--an ethereal band","Are visible above: the Seasons four,--","Green-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store","In Autumn&apos;s sickle, Winter frosty hoar,","Join dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,","In swells unmitigated, still doth last","To sway their floating morris. &quot;Whose is this?","Whose bugle?&quot; he inquires: they smile--&quot;O Dis!","Why is this mortal here? Dost thou not know","Its mistress&apos; lips? Not thou?--&apos;Tis Dian&apos;s: lo!","She rises crescented!&quot; He looks, &apos;tis she,","His very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,","And air, and pains, and care, and suffering;","Good-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring","Towards her, and awakes--and, strange, o&apos;erhead,","Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,","Beheld awake his very dream: the gods","Stood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;","And Phoebe bends towards him crescented.","O state perplexing! On the pinion bed,","Too well awake, he feels the panting side","Of his delicious lady. He who died","For soaring too audacious in the sun,","Where that same treacherous wax began to run,","Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.","His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,","To that fair shadow&apos;d passion puls&apos;d its way--","Ah, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!","So fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,","He could not help but kiss her: then he grew","Awhile forgetful of all beauty save","Young Phoebe&apos;s, golden hair&apos;d; and so &apos;gan crave","Forgiveness: yet he turn&apos;d once more to look","At the sweet sleeper,--all his soul was shook,--","She press&apos;d his hand in slumber; so once more","He could not help but kiss her and adore.","At this the shadow wept, melting away.","The Latmian started up: &quot;Bright goddess, stay!","Search my most hidden breast! By truth&apos;s own tongue,","I have no d&#xE6;dale heart: why is it wrung","To desperation? Is there nought for me,","Upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?&quot;","","  These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:","Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses","With &apos;haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.","&quot;Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe","This murky phantasm! thou contented seem&apos;st","Pillow&apos;d in lovely idleness, nor dream&apos;st","What horrors may discomfort thee and me.","Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!--","Yet did she merely weep--her gentle soul","Hath no revenge in it: as it is whole","In tenderness, would I were whole in love!","Can I prize thee, fair maid, all price above,","Even when I feel as true as innocence?","I do, I do.--What is this soul then? Whence","Came it? It does not seem my own, and I","Have no self-passion or identity.","Some fearful end must be: where, where is it?","By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit","Alone about the dark--Forgive me, sweet:","Shall we away?&quot; He rous&apos;d the steeds: they beat","Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,","Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.","","  The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,","And Vesper, risen star, began to throe","In the dusk heavens silvery, when they","Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.","Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange--","Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,","In such wise, in such temper, so aloof","Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,","So witless of their doom, that verily","&apos;Tis well nigh past man&apos;s search their hearts to see;","Whether they wept, or laugh&apos;d, or griev&apos;d, or toy&apos;d--","Most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy&apos;d.","","  Full facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,","The moon put forth a little diamond peak,","No bigger than an unobserved star,","Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;","Bright signal that she only stoop&apos;d to tie","Her silver sandals, ere deliciously","She bow&apos;d into the heavens her timid head.","Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,","While to his lady meek the Carian turn&apos;d,","To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern&apos;d","This beauty in its birth--Despair! despair!","He saw her body fading gaunt and spare","In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz&apos;d her wrist;","It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss&apos;d,","And, horror! kiss&apos;d his own--he was alone.","Her steed a little higher soar&apos;d, and then","Dropt hawkwise to the earth.        There lies a den,","Beyond the seeming confines of the space","Made for the soul to wander in and trace","Its own existence, of remotest glooms.","Dark regions are around it, where the tombs","Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce","One hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce","Of new-born woe it feels more inly smart:","And in these regions many a venom&apos;d dart","At random flies; they are the proper home","Of every ill: the man is yet to come","Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.","But few have ever felt how calm and well","Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.","There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:","Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,","Yet all is still within and desolate.","Beset with painful gusts, within ye hear","No sound so loud as when on curtain&apos;d bier","The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none","Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.","Just when the sufferer begins to burn,","Then it is free to him; and from an urn,","Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught--","Young Semele such richness never quaft","In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!","Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom","Of health by due; where silence dreariest","Is most articulate; where hopes infest;","Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep","Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.","O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!","Pregnant with such a den to save the whole","In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!","For, never since thy griefs and woes began,","Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud","Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.","Aye, his lull&apos;d soul was there, although upborne","With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn","Because he knew not whither he was going.","So happy was he, not the aerial blowing","Of trumpets at clear parley from the east","Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.","They stung the feather&apos;d horse: with fierce alarm","He flapp&apos;d towards the sound. Alas, no charm","Could lift Endymion&apos;s head, or he had view&apos;d","A skyey mask, a pinion&apos;d multitude,--","And silvery was its passing: voices sweet","Warbling the while as if to lull and greet","The wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,","While past the vision went in bright array.","","  &quot;Who, who from Dian&apos;s feast would be away?","For all the golden bowers of the day","Are empty left? Who, who away would be","From Cynthia&apos;s wedding and festivity?","Not Hesperus: lo! upon his silver wings","He leans away for highest heaven and sings,","Snapping his lucid fingers merrily!--","Ah, Zephyrus! art here, and Flora too!","Ye tender bibbers of the rain and dew,","Young playmates of the rose and daffodil,","Be careful, ere ye enter in, to fill","        Your baskets high","With fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,","Savory, latter-mint, and columbines,","Cool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;","Yea, every flower and leaf of every clime,","All gather&apos;d in the dewy morning: hie","        Away! fly, fly!--","Crystalline brother of the belt of heaven,","Aquarius! to whom king Jove has given","Two liquid pulse streams &apos;stead of feather&apos;d wings,","Two fan-like fountains,--thine illuminings","        For Dian play:","Dissolve the frozen purity of air;","Let thy white shoulders silvery and bare","Shew cold through watery pinions; make more bright","The Star-Queen&apos;s crescent on her marriage night:","        Haste, haste away!--","Castor has tamed the planet Lion, see!","And of the Bear has Pollux mastery:","A third is in the race! who is the third,","Speeding away swift as the eagle bird?","        The ramping Centaur!","The Lion&apos;s mane&apos;s on end: the Bear how fierce!","The Centaur&apos;s arrow ready seems to pierce","Some enemy: far forth his bow is bent","Into the blue of heaven.

Where?--who? who","Left thee so quiet on this bed of dew?","Behold upon this happy earth we are;","Let us ay love each other; let us fare","On forest-fruits, and never, never go","Among the abodes of mortals here below,","Or be by phantoms duped. O destiny!","Into a labyrinth now my soul would fly,","But with thy beauty will I deaden it.","Where didst thou melt too? By thee will I sit","For ever: let our fate stop here--a kid","I on this spot will offer: Pan will bid","Us live in peace, in love and peace among","His forest wildernesses. I have clung","To nothing, lov&apos;d a nothing, nothing seen","Or felt but a great dream! O I have been","Presumptuous against love, against the sky,","Against all elements, against the tie","Of mortals each to each, against the blooms","Of flowers, rush of rivers, and the tombs","Of heroes gone! Against his proper glory","Has my own soul conspired: so my story","Will I to children utter, and repent.","There never liv&apos;d a mortal man, who bent","His appetite beyond his natural sphere,","But starv&apos;d and died. My sweetest Indian, here,","Here will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast","My life from too thin breathing: gone and past","Are cloudy phantasms. Caverns lone, farewel!","And air of visions, and the monstrous swell","Of visionary seas! No, never more","Shall airy voices cheat me to the shore","Of tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.","Adieu, my daintiest Dream! although so vast","My love is still for thee. The hour may come","When we shall meet in pure elysium.","On earth I may not love thee; and therefore","Doves will I offer up, and sweetest store","All through the teeming year: so thou wilt shine","On me, and on this damsel fair of mine,","And bless our simple lives. My Indian bliss!","My river-lily bud! one human kiss!","One sigh of real breath--one gentle squeeze,","Warm as a dove&apos;s nest among summer trees,","And warm with dew at ooze from living blood!","Whither didst melt? Ah, what of that!--all good","We&apos;ll talk about--no more of dreaming.--Now,","Where shall our dwelling be? Under the brow","Of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun","Would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;","And where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,","Will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?","O thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;","Dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace","Those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin&apos;d:","For by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,","And by another, in deep dell below,","See, through the trees, a little river go","All in its mid-day gold and glimmering.","Honey from out the gnarled hive I&apos;ll bring,","And apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,--","Cresses that grow where no man may them see,","And sorrel untorn by the dew-claw&apos;d stag:","Pipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,","That thou mayst always know whither I roam,","When it shall please thee in our quiet home","To listen and think of love. Still let me speak;","Still let me dive into the joy I seek,--","For yet the past doth prison me. The rill,","Thou haply mayst delight in, will I fill","With fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,","And thou shalt feed them from the squirrel&apos;s barn.","Its bottom will I strew with amber shells,","And pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.","Its sides I&apos;ll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,","And honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.","I will entice this crystal rill to trace","Love&apos;s silver name upon the meadow&apos;s face.","I&apos;ll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;","And to god Phoebus, for a golden lyre;","To Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;","To Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,","That I may see thy beauty through the night;","To Flora, and a nightingale shall light","Tame on thy finger; to the River-gods,","And they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods","Of gold, and lines of Naiads&apos; long bright tress.","Heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!","Thy mossy footstool shall the altar be","&apos;Fore which I&apos;ll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:","Those lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak","Laws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,","Trembling or stedfastness to this same voice,","And of three sweetest pleasurings the choice:","And that affectionate light, those diamond things,","Those eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,","Shall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure.","Say, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?","O that I could not doubt?&quot;","","                              The mountaineer","Thus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear","His briar&apos;d path to some tranquillity.","It gave bright gladness to his lady&apos;s eye,","And yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;","Answering thus, just as the golden morrow","Beam&apos;d upward from the vallies of the east:","&quot;O that the flutter of this heart had ceas&apos;d,","Or the sweet name of love had pass&apos;d away.","Young feather&apos;d tyrant! by a swift decay","Wilt thou devote this body to the earth:","And I do think that at my very birth","I lisp&apos;d thy blooming titles inwardly;","For at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,","With uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.","Art thou not cruel? Ever have I striven","To think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!","When yet a child, I heard that kisses drew","Favour from thee, and so I kisses gave","To the void air, bidding them find out love:","But when I came to feel how far above","All fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,","All earthly pleasure, all imagin&apos;d good,","Was the warm tremble of a devout kiss,--","Even then, that moment, at the thought of this,","Fainting I fell into a bed of flowers,","And languish&apos;d there three days. Ye milder powers,","Am I not cruelly wrong&apos;d? Believe, believe","Me, dear Endymion, were I to weave","With my own fancies garlands of sweet life,","Thou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!","I may not be thy love: I am forbidden--","Indeed I am--thwarted, affrighted, chidden,","By things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.","Twice hast thou ask&apos;d whither I went: henceforth","Ask me no more! I may not utter it,","Nor may I be thy love. We might commit","Ourselves at once to vengeance; we might die;","We might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!","Enlarge not to my hunger, or I&apos;m caught","In trammels of perverse deliciousness.","No, no, that shall not be: thee will I bless,","And bid a long adieu.&quot;","","                          The Carian","No word return&apos;d: both lovelorn, silent, wan,","Into the vallies green together went.","Far wandering, they were perforce content","To sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;","Nor at each other gaz&apos;d, but heavily","Por&apos;d on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves.","","  Endymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves","Me to behold thee thus in last extreme:","Ensky&apos;d ere this, but truly that I deem","Truth the best music in a first-born song.","Thy lute-voic&apos;d brother will I sing ere long,","And thou shalt aid--hast thou not aided me?","Yes, moonlight Emperor! felicity","Has been thy meed for many thousand years;","Yet often have I, on the brink of tears,","Mourn&apos;d as if yet thou wert a forester,--","Forgetting the old tale.","","                            He did not stir","His eyes from the dead leaves, or one small pulse","Of joy he might have felt. The spirit culls","Unfaded amaranth, when wild it strays","Through the old garden-ground of boyish days.","A little onward ran the very stream","By which he took his first soft poppy dream;","And on the very bark &apos;gainst which he leant","A crescent he had carv&apos;d, and round it spent","His skill in little stars. The teeming tree","Had swollen and green&apos;d the pious charactery,","But not ta&apos;en out. Why, there was not a slope","Up which he had not fear&apos;d the antelope;","And not a tree, beneath whose rooty shade","He had not with his tamed leopards play&apos;d.","Nor could an arrow light, or javelin,","Fly in the air where his had never been--","And yet he knew it not.","","                          O treachery!","Why does his lady smile, pleasing her eye","With all his sorrowing? He sees her not.","But who so stares on him? His sister sure!","Peona of the woods!--Can she endure--","Impossible--how dearly they embrace!","His lady smiles; delight is in her face;","It is no treachery.","","                      &quot;Dear brother mine!","Endymion, weep not so! Why shouldst thou pine","When all great Latmos so exalt wilt be?","Thank the great gods, and look not bitterly;","And speak not one pale word, and sigh no more.","Sure I will not believe thou hast such store","Of grief, to last thee to my kiss again.","Thou surely canst not bear a mind in pain,","Come hand in hand with one so beautiful.","Be happy both of you! for I will pull","The flowers of autumn for your coronals.","Pan&apos;s holy priest for young Endymion calls;","And when he is restor&apos;d, thou, fairest dame,","Shalt be our queen. Now, is it not a shame","To see ye thus,--not very, very sad?","Perhaps ye are too happy to be glad:","O feel as if it were a common day;","Free-voic&apos;d as one who never was away.","No tongue shall ask, whence come ye? but ye shall","Be gods of your own rest imperial.","Not even I, for one whole month, will pry","Into the hours that have pass&apos;d us by,","Since in my arbour I did sing to thee.","O Hermes! on this very night will be","A hymning up to Cynthia, queen of light;","For the soothsayers old saw yesternight","Good visions in the air,--whence will befal,","As say these sages, health perpetual","To shepherds and their flocks; and furthermore,","In Dian&apos;s face they read the gentle lore:","Therefore for her these vesper-carols are.","Our friends will all be there from nigh and far.","Many upon thy death have ditties made;","And many, even now, their foreheads shade","With cypress, on a day of sacrifice.","New singing for our maids shalt thou devise,","And pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen&apos;s brows.","Tell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse","This wayward brother to his rightful joys!","His eyes are on thee bent, as thou didst poise","His fate most goddess-like. Help me, I pray,","To lure--Endymion, dear brother, say","What ails thee?&quot; He could bear no more, and so","Bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,","And twang&apos;d it inwardly, and calmly said:","&quot;I would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!","My only visitor! not ignorant though,","That those deceptions which for pleasure go","&apos;Mong men, are pleasures real as real may be:","But there are higher ones I may not see,","If impiously an earthly realm I take.","Since I saw thee, I have been wide awake","Night after night, and day by day, until","Of the empyrean I have drunk my fill.","Let it content thee, Sister, seeing me","More happy than betides mortality.","A hermit young, I&apos;ll live in mossy cave,","Where thou alone shalt come to me, and lave","Thy spirit in the wonders I shall tell.","Through me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;","For to thy tongue will I all health confide.","And, for my sake, let this young maid abide","With thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,","Peona, mayst return to me. I own","This may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,","Thou seest it for my happiness, no pearl","Will trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!","Wilt be content to dwell with her, to share","This sister&apos;s love with me?&quot; Like one resign&apos;d","And bent by circumstance, and thereby blind","In self-commitment, thus that meek unknown:","&quot;Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,","Of jubilee to Dian:--truth I heard!","Well then, I see there is no little bird,","Tender soever, but is Jove&apos;s own care.","Long have I sought for rest, and, unaware,","Behold I find it! so exalted too!","So after my own heart! I knew, I knew","There was a place untenanted in it:","In that same void white Chastity shall sit,","And monitor me nightly to lone slumber.","With sanest lips I vow me to the number","Of Dian&apos;s sisterhood; and, kind lady,","With thy good help, this very night shall see","My future days to her fane consecrate.&quot;","","  As feels a dreamer what doth most create","His own particular fright, so these three felt:","Or like one who, in after ages, knelt","To Lucifer or Baal, when he&apos;d pine","After a little sleep: or when in mine","Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends","Who know him not. Each diligently bends","Towards common thoughts and things for very fear;","Striving their ghastly malady to cheer,","By thinking it a thing of yes and no,","That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow","Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last","Endymion said: &quot;Are not our fates all cast?","Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!","Adieu!&quot; Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,","Walk&apos;d dizzily away. Pained and hot","His eyes went after them, until they got","Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,","In one swift moment, would what then he saw","Engulph for ever. &quot;Stay!&quot; he cried, &quot;ah, stay!","Turn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.","Sweet Indian, I would see thee once again.","It is a thing I dote on: so I&apos;d fain,","Peona, ye should hand in hand repair","Into those holy groves, that silent are","Behind great Dian&apos;s temple. I&apos;ll be yon,","At vesper&apos;s earliest twinkle--they are gone--","But once, once, once again--&quot; At this he press&apos;d","His hands against his face, and then did rest","His head upon a mossy hillock green,","And so remain&apos;d as he a corpse had been","All the long day; save when he scantly lifted","His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted","With the slow move of time,--sluggish and weary","Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,","Had reach&apos;d the river&apos;s brim. Then up he rose,","And, slowly as that very river flows,","Walk&apos;d towards the temple grove with this lament:","&quot;Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent","Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall","Before the serene father of them all","Bows down his summer head below the west.","Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,","But at the setting I must bid adieu","To her for the last time. Night will strew","On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,","And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves","To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.","Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord","Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,","Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;","My kingdom&apos;s at its death, and just it is","That I should die with it: so in all this","We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,","What is there to plain of? By Titan&apos;s foe","I am but rightly serv&apos;d.&quot; So saying, he","Tripp&apos;d lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;","Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,","As though they jests had been: nor had he done","His laugh at nature&apos;s holy countenance,","Until that grove appear&apos;d, as if perchance,","And then his tongue with sober seemlihed","Gave utterance as he entered: &quot;Ha!&quot; I said,","&quot;King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,","And by old Rhadamanthus&apos; tongue of doom,","This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,","And the Promethean clay by thief endued,","By old Saturnus&apos; forelock, by his head","Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed","Myself to things of light from infancy;","And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,","Is sure enough to make a mortal man","Grow impious.&quot; So he inwardly began","On things for which no wording can be found;","Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown&apos;d","Beyond the reach of music: for the choir","Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar","Nor muffling thicket interpos&apos;d to dull","The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,","Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.","He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,","Wan as primroses gather&apos;d at midnight","By chilly finger&apos;d spring. &quot;Unhappy wight!","Endymion!&quot; said Peona, &quot;we are here!","What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?&quot;","Then he embrac&apos;d her, and his lady&apos;s hand","Press&apos;d, saying:&quot; Sister, I would have command,","If it were heaven&apos;s will, on our sad fate.&quot;","At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate","And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,","To Endymion&apos;s amaze: &quot;By Cupid&apos;s dove,","And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth","Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!&quot;","And as she spake, into her face there came","Light, as reflected from a silver flame:","Her long black hair swell&apos;d ampler, in display","Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day","Dawn&apos;d blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld","Phoebe, his passion! joyous she upheld","Her lucid bow, continuing thus; &quot;Drear, drear","Has our delaying been; but foolish fear","Withheld me first; and then decrees of fate;","And then &apos;twas fit that from this mortal state","Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook&apos;d for change","Be spiritualiz&apos;d. Peona, we shall range","These forests, and to thee they safe shall be","As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee","To meet us many a time.&quot; Next Cynthia bright","Peona kiss&apos;d, and bless&apos;d with fair good night:","Her brother kiss&apos;d her too, and knelt adown","Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon.","She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,","Before three swiftest kisses he had told,","They vanish&apos;d far away!--Peona went","Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment. \n                        ","\n                    "],["\n                        There are who lord it o&apos;er their fellow-men","With most prevailing tinsel: who unpen","Their baaing vanities, to browse away","The comfortable green and juicy hay","From human pastures; or, O torturing fact!","Who, through an idiot blink, will see unpack&apos;d","Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe","Our gold and ripe-ear&apos;d hopes. With not one tinge","Of sanctuary splendour, not a sight","Able to face an owl&apos;s, they still are dight","By the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,","And crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,","Save of blown self-applause, they proudly mount","To their spirit&apos;s perch, their being&apos;s high account,","Their tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones--","Amid the fierce intoxicating tones","Of trumpets, shoutings, and belabour&apos;d drums,","And sudden cannon. Ah! how all this hums,","In wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone--","Like thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,","And set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.--","Are then regalities all gilded masks?","No, there are throned seats unscalable","But by a patient wing, a constant spell,","Or by ethereal things that, unconfin&apos;d,","Can make a ladder of the eternal wind,","And poise about in cloudy thunder-tents","To watch the abysm-birth of elements.","Aye, &apos;bove the withering of old-lipp&apos;d Fate","A thousand Powers keep religious state,","In water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;","And, silent as a consecrated urn,","Hold sphery sessions for a season due.","Yet few of these far majesties, ah, few!","Have bared their operations to this globe--","Few, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe","Our piece of heaven--whose benevolence","Shakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense","Filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,","As bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud","&apos;Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,","Eterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair","Is of all these the gentlier-mightiest.","When thy gold breath is misting in the west,","She unobserved steals unto her throne,","And there she sits most meek and most alone;","As if she had not pomp subservient;","As if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent","Towards her with the Muses in thine heart;","As if the ministring stars kept not apart,","Waiting for silver-footed messages.","O Moon! the oldest shades &apos;mong oldest trees","Feel palpitations when thou lookest in:","O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din","The while they feel thine airy fellowship.","Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip","Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,","Couched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:","Innumerable mountains rise, and rise,","Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;","And yet thy benediction passeth not","One obscure hiding-place, one little spot","Where pleasure may be sent: the nested wren","Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,","And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf","Takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief","To the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps","Within its pearly house.--The mighty deeps,","The monstrous sea is thine--the myriad sea!","O Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,","And Tellus feels his forehead&apos;s cumbrous load.","","  Cynthia! where art thou now? What far abode","Of green or silvery bower doth enshrine","Such utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine","For one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale","For one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail","His tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?","Ah! surely that light peeps from Vesper&apos;s eye,","Or what a thing is love! &apos;Tis She, but lo!","How chang&apos;d, how full of ache, how gone in woe!","She dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness","Is wan on Neptune&apos;s blue: yet there&apos;s a stress","Of love-spangles, just off yon cape of trees,","Dancing upon the waves, as if to please","The curly foam with amorous influence.","O, not so idle: for down-glancing thence","She fathoms eddies, and runs wild about","O&apos;erwhelming water-courses; scaring out","The thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright&apos;ning","Their savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning.","Where will the splendor be content to reach?","O love! how potent hast thou been to teach","Strange journeyings! Wherever beauty dwells,","In gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,","In light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,","Thou pointest out the way, and straight &apos;tis won.","Amid his toil thou gav&apos;st Leander breath;","Thou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;","Thou madest Pluto bear thin element;","And now, O winged Chieftain! thou hast sent","A moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,","To find Endymion.","","                  On gold sand impearl&apos;d","With lily shells, and pebbles milky white,","Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth&apos;d her light","Against his pallid face: he felt the charm","To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm","Of his heart&apos;s blood: &apos;twas very sweet; he stay&apos;d","His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid","His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,","To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,","Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes&apos; tails.","And so he kept, until the rosy veils","Mantling the east, by Aurora&apos;s peering hand","Were lifted from the water&apos;s breast, and fann&apos;d","Into sweet air; and sober&apos;d morning came","Meekly through billows:--when like taper-flame","Left sudden by a dallying breath of air,","He rose in silence, and once more &apos;gan fare","Along his fated way.","","                      Far had he roam&apos;d,","With nothing save the hollow vast, that foam&apos;d","Above, around, and at his feet; save things","More dead than Morpheus&apos; imaginings:","Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large","Of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;","Rudders that for a hundred years had lost","The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss&apos;d","With long-forgotten story, and wherein","No reveller had ever dipp&apos;d a chin","But those of Saturn&apos;s vintage; mouldering scrolls,","Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls","Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude","In ponderous stone, developing the mood","Of ancient Nox;--then skeletons of man,","Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,","And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw","Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe","These secrets struck into him; and unless","Dian had chaced away that heaviness,","He might have died: but now, with cheered feel,","He onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal","About the labyrinth in his soul of love.","","  &quot;What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move","My heart so potently? When yet a child","I oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil&apos;d.","Thou seem&apos;dst my sister: hand in hand we went","From eve to morn across the firmament.","No apples would I gather from the tree,","Till thou hadst cool&apos;d their cheeks deliciously:","No tumbling water ever spake romance,","But when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:","No woods were green enough, no bower divine,","Until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:","In sowing time ne&apos;er would I dibble take,","Or drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;","And, in the summer tide of blossoming,","No one but thee hath heard me blithly sing","And mesh my dewy flowers all the night.","No melody was like a passing spright","If it went not to solemnize thy reign.","Yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain","By thee were fashion&apos;d to the self-same end;","And as I grew in years, still didst thou blend","With all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;","Thou wast the mountain-top--the sage&apos;s pen--","The poet&apos;s harp--the voice of friends--the sun;","Thou wast the river--thou wast glory won;","Thou wast my clarion&apos;s blast--thou wast my steed--","My goblet full of wine--my topmost deed:--","Thou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!","O what a wild and harmonized tune","My spirit struck from all the beautiful!","On some bright essence could I lean, and lull","Myself to immortality: I prest","Nature&apos;s soft pillow in a wakeful rest.","But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss--","My strange love came--Felicity&apos;s abyss!","She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away--","Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway","Has been an under-passion to this hour.","Now I begin to feel thine orby power","Is coming fresh upon me: O be kind,","Keep back thine influence, and do not blind","My sovereign vision.--Dearest love, forgive","That I can think away from thee and live!--","Pardon me, airy planet, that I prize","One thought beyond thine argent luxuries!","How far beyond!&quot; At this a surpris&apos;d start","Frosted the springing verdure of his heart;","For as he lifted up his eyes to swear","How his own goddess was past all things fair,","He saw far in the concave green of the sea","An old man sitting calm and peacefully.","Upon a weeded rock this old man sat,","And his white hair was awful, and a mat","Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;","And, ample as the largest winding-sheet,","A cloak of blue wrapp&apos;d up his aged bones,","O&apos;erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans","Of ambitious magic: every ocean-form","Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,","And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar","Were emblem&apos;d in the woof; with every shape","That skims, or dives, or sleeps, &apos;twixt cape and cape.","The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,","Yet look upon it, and &apos;twould size and swell","To its huge self; and the minutest fish","Would pass the very hardest gazer&apos;s wish,","And show his little eye&apos;s anatomy.","Then there was pictur&apos;d the regality","Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,","In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.","Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,","And in his lap a book, the which he conn&apos;d","So stedfastly, that the new denizen","Had time to keep him in amazed ken,","To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.","","  The old man rais&apos;d his hoary head and saw","The wilder&apos;d stranger--seeming not to see,","His features were so lifeless. Suddenly","He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows","Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs","Furrow&apos;d deep wrinkles in his forehead large,","Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,","Till round his wither&apos;d lips had gone a smile.","Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil","Had watch&apos;d for years in forlorn hermitage,","Who had not from mid-life to utmost age","Eas&apos;d in one accent his o&apos;er-burden&apos;d soul,","Even to the trees. He rose: he grasp&apos;d his stole,","With convuls&apos;d clenches waving it abroad,","And in a voice of solemn joy, that aw&apos;d","Echo into oblivion, he said:--","","  &quot;Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head","In peace upon my watery pillow: now","Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.","O Jove! I shall be young again, be young!","O shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc&apos;d and stung","With new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,","When I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?--","I&apos;ll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen","Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;","Anon upon that giant&apos;s arm I&apos;ll be,","That writhes about the roots of Sicily:","To northern seas I&apos;ll in a twinkling sail,","And mount upon the snortings of a whale","To some black cloud; thence down I&apos;ll madly sweep","On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,","Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl&apos;d","With rapture to the other side of the world!","O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,","I bow full hearted to your old decree!","Yes, every god be thank&apos;d, and power benign,","For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.","Thou art the man!&quot; Endymion started back","Dismay&apos;d; and, like a wretch from whom the rack","Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,","Mutter&apos;d: &quot;What lonely death am I to die","In this cold region? Will he let me freeze,","And float my brittle limbs o&apos;er polar seas?","Or will he touch me with his searing hand,","And leave a black memorial on the sand?","Or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,","And keep me as a chosen food to draw","His magian fish through hated fire and flame?","O misery of hell! resistless, tame,","Am I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,","Until the gods through heaven&apos;s blue look out!--","O Tartarus! but some few days agone","Her soft arms were entwining me, and on","Her voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:","Her lips were all my own, and--ah, ripe sheaves","Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,","But never may be garner&apos;d. I must stoop","My head, and kiss death&apos;s foot. Love! love, farewel!","Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell","Would melt at thy sweet breath.--By Dian&apos;s hind","Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind","I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,","I care not for this old mysterious man!&quot;","","  He spake, and walking to that aged form,","Look&apos;d high defiance. Lo! his heart &apos;gan warm","With pity, for the grey-hair&apos;d creature wept.","Had he then wrong&apos;d a heart where sorrow kept?","Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought","Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,","Convulsion to a mouth of many years?","He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.","The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt","Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt","About his large dark locks, and faultering spake:","","  &quot;Arise, good youth, for sacred Phoebus&apos; sake!","I know thine inmost bosom, and I feel","A very brother&apos;s yearning for thee steal","Into mine own: for why? thou openest","The prison gates that have so long opprest","My weary watching. Though thou know&apos;st it not,","Thou art commission&apos;d to this fated spot","For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;","I am a friend to love, to loves of yore:","Aye, hadst thou never lov&apos;d an unknown power","I had been grieving at this joyous hour","But even now most miserable old,","I saw thee, and my blood no longer cold","Gave mighty pulses: in this tottering case","Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays","As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,","For thou shalt hear this secret all display&apos;d,","Now as we speed towards our joyous task.&quot;","","  So saying, this young soul in age&apos;s mask","Went forward with the Carian side by side:","Resuming quickly thus; while ocean&apos;s tide","Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel&apos;d sands","Took silently their foot-prints. &quot;My soul stands","Now past the midway from mortality,","And so I can prepare without a sigh","To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.","I was a fisher once, upon this main,","And my boat danc&apos;d in every creek and bay;","Rough billows were my home by night and day,--","The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had","No housing from the storm and tempests mad,","But hollow rocks,--and they were palaces","Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease:","Long years of misery have told me so.","Aye, thus it was one thousand years ago.","One thousand years!--Is it then possible","To look so plainly through them? to dispel","A thousand years with backward glance sublime?","To breathe away as &apos;twere all scummy slime","From off a crystal pool, to see its deep,","And one&apos;s own image from the bottom peep?","Yes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,","My long captivity and moanings all","Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,","The which I breathe away, and thronging come","Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.","","  &quot;I touch&apos;d no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:","I was a lonely youth on desert shores.","My sports were lonely, &apos;mid continuous roars,","And craggy isles, and sea-mew&apos;s plaintive cry","Plaining discrepant between sea and sky.","Dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen","Would let me feel their scales of gold and green,","Nor be my desolation; and, full oft,","When a dread waterspout had rear&apos;d aloft","Its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe","To burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe","My life away like a vast sponge of fate,","Some friendly monster, pitying my sad state,","Has dived to its foundations, gulph&apos;d it down,","And left me tossing safely. But the crown","Of all my life was utmost quietude:","More did I love to lie in cavern rude,","Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune&apos;s voice,","And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!","There blush&apos;d no summer eve but I would steer","My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear","The shepherd&apos;s pipe come clear from aery steep,","Mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:","And never was a day of summer shine,","But I beheld its birth upon the brine:","For I would watch all night to see unfold","Heaven&apos;s gates, and Aethon snort his morning gold","Wide o&apos;er the swelling streams: and constantly","At brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,","My nets would be spread out, and I at rest.","The poor folk of the sea-country I blest","With daily boon of fish most delicate:","They knew not whence this bounty, and elate","Would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.","","  &quot;Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach","At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!","Had been my dreary death? Fool! I began","To feel distemper&apos;d longings: to desire","The utmost privilege that ocean&apos;s sire","Could grant in benediction: to be free","Of all his kingdom. Long in misery","I wasted, ere in one extremest fit","I plung&apos;d for life or death. To interknit","One&apos;s senses with so dense a breathing stuff","Might seem a work of pain; so not enough","Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,","And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt","Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;","Forgetful utterly of self-intent;","Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.","Then, like a new fledg&apos;d bird that first doth shew","His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,","I tried in fear the pinions of my will.","&apos;Twas freedom! and at once I visited","The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.","No need to tell thee of them, for I see","That thou hast been a witness--it must be","For these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,","By the melancholy corners of that mouth.","So I will in my story straightway pass","To more immediate matter. Woe, alas!","That love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!","Why did poor Glaucus ever--ever dare","To sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!","I lov&apos;d her to the very white of truth,","And she would not conceive it. Timid thing!","She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,","Round every isle, and point, and promontory,","From where large Hercules wound up his story","Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew","The more, the more I saw her dainty hue","Gleam delicately through the azure clear:","Until &apos;twas too fierce agony to bear;","And in that agony, across my grief","It flash&apos;d, that Circe might find some relief--","Cruel enchantress! So above the water","I rear&apos;d my head, and look&apos;d for Phoebus&apos; daughter.","Aeaea&apos;s isle was wondering at the moon:--","It seem&apos;d to whirl around me, and a swoon","Left me dead-drifting to that fatal power.","","  &quot;When I awoke, &apos;twas in a twilight bower;","Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,","Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.","How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,","And over it a sighing voice expire.","It ceased--I caught light footsteps; and anon","The fairest face that morn e&apos;er look&apos;d upon","Push&apos;d through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!","With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove","A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all","The range of flower&apos;d Elysium. Thus did fall","The dew of her rich speech: &quot;Ah! Art awake?","O let me hear thee speak, for Cupid&apos;s sake!","I am so oppress&apos;d with joy! Why, I have shed","An urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;","And now I find thee living, I will pour","From these devoted eyes their silver store,","Until exhausted of the latest drop,","So it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop","Here, that I too may live: but if beyond","Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond","Of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;","If thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;","If smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,","Hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,","O let me pluck it for thee.&quot; Thus she link&apos;d","Her charming syllables, till indistinct","Their music came to my o&apos;er-sweeten&apos;d soul;","And then she hover&apos;d over me, and stole","So near, that if no nearer it had been","This furrow&apos;d visage thou hadst never seen.","","  &quot;Young man of Latmos! thus particular","Am I, that thou may&apos;st plainly see how far","This fierce temptation went: and thou may&apos;st not","Exclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?","","  &quot;Who could resist? Who in this universe?","She did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse","My fine existence in a golden clime.","She took me like a child of suckling time,","And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn&apos;d,","The current of my former life was stemm&apos;d,","And to this arbitrary queen of sense","I bow&apos;d a tranced vassal: nor would thence","Have mov&apos;d, even though Amphion&apos;s harp had woo&apos;d","Me back to Scylla o&apos;er the billows rude.","For as Apollo each eve doth devise","A new appareling for western skies;","So every eve, nay every spendthrift hour","Shed balmy consciousness within that bower.","And I was free of haunts umbrageous;","Could wander in the mazy forest-house","Of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler&apos;d deer,","And birds from coverts innermost and drear","Warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow--","To me new born delights!","","                          &quot;Now let me borrow,","For moments few, a temperament as stern","As Pluto&apos;s sceptre, that my words not burn","These uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell","How specious heaven was changed to real hell.","","  &quot;One morn she left me sleeping: half awake","I sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake","My greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;","But she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts","Of disappointment stuck in me so sore,","That out I ran and search&apos;d the forest o&apos;er.","Wandering about in pine and cedar gloom","Damp awe assail&apos;d me; for there &apos;gan to boom","A sound of moan, an agony of sound,","Sepulchral from the distance all around.","Then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled","That fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled","Down a precipitous path, as if impell&apos;d.","I came to a dark valley.--Groanings swell&apos;d","Poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,","The nearer I approach&apos;d a flame&apos;s gaunt blue,","That glar&apos;d before me through a thorny brake.","This fire, like the eye of gordian snake,","Bewitch&apos;d me towards; and I soon was near","A sight too fearful for the feel of fear:","In thicket hid I curs&apos;d the haggard scene--","The banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,","Seated upon an uptorn forest root;","And all around her shapes, wizard and brute,","Laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,","Shewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!","O such deformities! Old Charon&apos;s self,","Should he give up awhile his penny pelf,","And take a dream &apos;mong rushes Stygian,","It could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,","And tyrannizing was the lady&apos;s look,","As over them a gnarled staff she shook.","Oft-times upon the sudden she laugh&apos;d out,","And from a basket emptied to the rout","Clusters of grapes, the which they raven&apos;d quick","And roar&apos;d for more; with many a hungry lick","About their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,","Anon she took a branch of mistletoe,","And emptied on&apos;t a black dull-gurgling phial:","Groan&apos;d one and all, as if some piercing trial","Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.","She lifted up the charm: appealing groans","From their poor breasts went sueing to her ear","In vain; remorseless as an infant&apos;s bier","She whisk&apos;d against their eyes the sooty oil.","Whereat was heard a noise of painful toil,","Increasing gradual to a tempest rage,","Shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;","Until their grieved bodies &apos;gan to bloat","And puff from the tail&apos;s end to stifled throat:","Then was appalling silence: then a sight","More wildering than all that hoarse affright;","For the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,","Went through the dismal air like one huge Python","Antagonizing Boreas,--and so vanish&apos;d.","Yet there was not a breath of wind: she banish&apos;d","These phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark","Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,","With dancing and loud revelry,--and went","Swifter than centaurs after rapine bent.--","Sighing an elephant appear&apos;d and bow&apos;d","Before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud","In human accent: &quot;Potent goddess! chief","Of pains resistless! make my being brief,","Or let me from this heavy prison fly:","Or give me to the air, or let me die!","I sue not for my happy crown again;","I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;","I sue not for my lone, my widow&apos;d wife;","I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,","My children fair, my lovely girls and boys!","I will forget them; I will pass these joys;","Ask nought so heavenward, so too--too high:","Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die,","Or be deliver&apos;d from this cumbrous flesh,","From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,","And merely given to the cold bleak air.","Have mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!&quot;","","  That curst magician&apos;s name fell icy numb","Upon my wild conjecturing: truth had come","Naked and sabre-like against my heart.","I saw a fury whetting a death-dart;","And my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,","Fainted away in that dark lair of night.","Think, my deliverer, how desolate","My waking must have been! disgust, and hate,","And terrors manifold divided me","A spoil amongst them. I prepar&apos;d to flee","Into the dungeon core of that wild wood:","I fled three days--when lo! before me stood","Glaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,","A clammy dew is beading on my brow,","At mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse.","&quot;Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse","Made of rose leaves and thistledown, express,","To cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,","I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:","My tenderest squeeze is but a giant&apos;s clutch.","So, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies","Unheard of yet; and it shall still its cries","Upon some breast more lily-feminine.","Oh, no--it shall not pine, and pine, and pine","More than one pretty, trifling thousand years;","And then &apos;twere pity, but fate&apos;s gentle shears","Cut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!","Young dove of the waters! truly I&apos;ll not hurt","One hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,","That our heart-broken parting is so nigh.","And must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so.","Yet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,","Let me sob over thee my last adieus,","And speak a blessing: Mark me! thou hast thews","Immortal, for thou art of heavenly race:","But such a love is mine, that here I chase","Eternally away from thee all bloom","Of youth, and destine thee towards a tomb.","Hence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;","And there, ere many days be overpast,","Disabled age shall seize thee; and even then","Thou shalt not go the way of aged men;","But live and wither, cripple and still breathe","Ten hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath","Thy fragile bones to unknown burial.","Adieu, sweet love, adieu!&quot;--As shot stars fall,","She fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung","And poisoned was my spirit: despair sung","A war-song of defiance &apos;gainst all hell.","A hand was at my shoulder to compel","My sullen steps; another &apos;fore my eyes","Moved on with pointed finger. In this guise","Enforced, at the last by ocean&apos;s foam","I found me; by my fresh, my native home.","Its tempering coolness, to my life akin,","Came salutary as I waded in;","And, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave","Battle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave","Large froth before me, while there yet remain&apos;d","Hale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain&apos;d.","","  &quot;Young lover, I must weep--such hellish spite","With dry cheek who can tell? While thus my might","Proving upon this element, dismay&apos;d,","Upon a dead thing&apos;s face my hand I laid;","I look&apos;d--&apos;twas Scylla! Cursed, cursed Circe!","O vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?","Could not thy harshest vengeance be content,","But thou must nip this tender innocent","Because I lov&apos;d her?--Cold, O cold indeed","Were her fair limbs, and like a common weed","The sea-swell took her hair. Dead as she was","I clung about her waist, nor ceas&apos;d to pass","Fleet as an arrow through unfathom&apos;d brine,","Until there shone a fabric crystalline,","Ribb&apos;d and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.","Headlong I darted; at one eager swirl","Gain&apos;d its bright portal, enter&apos;d, and behold!","&apos;Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;","And all around--But wherefore this to thee","Who in few minutes more thyself shalt see?--","I left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.","My fever&apos;d parchings up, my scathing dread","Met palsy half way: soon these limbs became","Gaunt, wither&apos;d, sapless, feeble, cramp&apos;d, and lame.","","  &quot;Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,","Without one hope, without one faintest trace","Of mitigation, or redeeming bubble","Of colour&apos;d phantasy; for I fear &apos;twould trouble","Thy brain to loss of reason: and next tell","How a restoring chance came down to quell","One half of the witch in me.                 On a day,","Sitting upon a rock above the spray,","I saw grow up from the horizon&apos;s brink","A gallant vessel: soon she seem&apos;d to sink","Away from me again, as though her course","Had been resum&apos;d in spite of hindering force--","So vanish&apos;d: and not long, before arose","Dark clouds, and muttering of winds morose.","Old Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,","But could not: therefore all the billows green","Toss&apos;d up the silver spume against the clouds.","The tempest came: I saw that vessel&apos;s shrouds","In perilous bustle; while upon the deck","Stood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;","The final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:","I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.","O they had all been sav&apos;d but crazed eld","Annull&apos;d my vigorous cravings: and thus quell&apos;d","And curb&apos;d, think on&apos;t, O Latmian! did I sit","Writhing with pity, and a cursing fit","Against that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,","By one and one, to pale oblivion;","And I was gazing on the surges prone,","With many a scalding tear and many a groan,","When at my feet emerg&apos;d an old man&apos;s hand,","Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.","I knelt with pain--reached out my hand--had grasp&apos;d","These treasures--touch&apos;d the knuckles--they unclasp&apos;d--","I caught a finger: but the downward weight","O&apos;erpowered me--it sank. Then &apos;gan abate","The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst","The comfortable sun. I was athirst","To search the book, and in the warming air","Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.","Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on","My soul page after page, till well-nigh won","Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,","I read these words, and read again, and tried","My eyes against the heavens, and read again.","O what a load of misery and pain","Each Atlas-line bore off!--a shine of hope","Came gold around me, cheering me to cope","Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!","For thou hast brought their promise to an end.","","  &quot;In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,","Doom&apos;d with enfeebled carcase to outstretch","His loath&apos;d existence through ten centuries,","And then to die alone. Who can devise","A total opposition? No one. So","One million times ocean must ebb and flow,","And he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,","These things accomplish&apos;d:--If he utterly","Scans all the depths of magic, and expounds","The meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;","If he explores all forms and substances","Straight homeward to their symbol-essences;","He shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,","He must pursue this task of joy and grief","Most piously;--all lovers tempest-tost,","And in the savage overwhelming lost,","He shall deposit side by side, until","Time&apos;s creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:","Which done, and all these labours ripened,","A youth, by heavenly power lov&apos;d and led,","Shall stand before him; whom he shall direct","How to consummate all. The youth elect","Must do the thing, or both will be destroy&apos;d.&quot;--","","  &quot;Then,&quot; cried the young Endymion, overjoy&apos;d,","&quot;We are twin brothers in this destiny!","Say, I intreat thee, what achievement high","Is, in this restless world, for me reserv&apos;d.","What! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv&apos;d,","Had we both perish&apos;d?&quot;--&quot;Look!&quot; the sage replied,","&quot;Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,","Of divers brilliances? &apos;tis the edifice","I told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;","And where I have enshrined piously","All lovers, whom fell storms have doom&apos;d to die","Throughout my bondage.&quot; Thus discoursing, on","They went till unobscur&apos;d the porches shone;","Which hurryingly they gain&apos;d, and enter&apos;d straight.","Sure never since king Neptune held his state","Was seen such wonder underneath the stars.","Turn to some level plain where haughty Mars","Has legion&apos;d all his battle; and behold","How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold","His even breast: see, many steeled squares,","And rigid ranks of iron--whence who dares","One step? Imagine further, line by line,","These warrior thousands on the field supine:--","So in that crystal place, in silent rows,","Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.--","The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac&apos;d","Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac&apos;d;","Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips","All ruddy,--for here death no blossom nips.","He mark&apos;d their brows and foreheads; saw their hair","Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;","And each one&apos;s gentle wrists, with reverence,","Put cross-wise to its heart.","","                              &quot;Let us commence,","Whisper&apos;d the guide, stuttering with joy, even now.&quot;","He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,","Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,","Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.","He tore it into pieces small as snow","That drifts unfeather&apos;d when bleak northerns blow;","And having done it, took his dark blue cloak","And bound it round Endymion: then struck","His wand against the empty air times nine.--","&quot;What more there is to do, young man, is thine:","But first a little patience; first undo","This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.","Ah, gentle! &apos;tis as weak as spider&apos;s skein;","And shouldst thou break it--What, is it done so clean?","A power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!","The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.","Here is a shell; &apos;tis pearly blank to me,","Nor mark&apos;d with any sign or charactery--","Canst thou read aught? O read for pity&apos;s sake!","Olympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break","This wand against yon lyre on the pedestal.&quot;","","  &apos;Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall","Sweet music breath&apos;d her soul away, and sigh&apos;d","A lullaby to silence.--&quot;Youth! now strew","These minced leaves on me, and passing through","Those files of dead, scatter the same around,","And thou wilt see the issue.&quot;--&apos;Mid the sound","Of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,","Endymion from Glaucus stood apart,","And scatter&apos;d in his face some fragments light.","How lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight","Smiling beneath a coral diadem,","Out-sparkling sudden like an upturn&apos;d gem,","Appear&apos;d, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,","Kneel&apos;d down beside it, and with tenderest force","Press&apos;d its cold hand, and wept--and Scylla sigh&apos;d!","Endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied--","The nymph arose: he left them to their joy,","And onward went upon his high employ,","Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.","And, as he pass&apos;d, each lifted up its head,","As doth a flower at Apollo&apos;s touch.","Death felt it to his inwards; &apos;twas too much:","Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.","The Latmian persever&apos;d along, and thus","All were re-animated. There arose","A noise of harmony, pulses and throes","Of gladness in the air--while many, who","Had died in mutual arms devout and true,","Sprang to each other madly; and the rest","Felt a high certainty of being blest.","They gaz&apos;d upon Endymion. Enchantment","Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent.","Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,","Budded, and swell&apos;d, and, full-blown, shed full showers","Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.","The two deliverers tasted a pure wine","Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz&apos;d out.","Speechless they eyed each other, and about","The fair assembly wander&apos;d to and fro,","Distracted with the richest overflow","Of joy that ever pour&apos;d from heaven.","","                                    ----&quot;Away!&quot;","Shouted the new-born god; &quot;Follow, and pay","Our piety to Neptunus supreme!&quot;--","Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,","They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,","Through portal columns of a giant size,","Into the vaulted, boundless emerald.","Joyous all follow&apos;d, as the leader call&apos;d,","Down marble steps; pouring as easily","As hour-glass sand--and fast, as you might see","Swallows obeying the south summer&apos;s call,","Or swans upon a gentle waterfall.","","  Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,","Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,","Just within ken, they saw descending thick","Another multitude. Whereat more quick","Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,","And of those numbers every eye was wet;","For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,","Like what was never heard in all the throes","Of wind and waters: &apos;tis past human wit","To tell; &apos;tis dizziness to think of it.","","  This mighty consummation made, the host","Mov&apos;d on for many a league; and gain&apos;d, and lost","Huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,","And from the rear diminishing away,--","Till a faint dawn surpris&apos;d them. Glaucus cried,","&quot;Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!","God Neptune&apos;s palaces!&quot; With noise increas&apos;d,","They shoulder&apos;d on towards that brightening east.","At every onward step proud domes arose","In prospect,--diamond gleams, and golden glows","Of amber &apos;gainst their faces levelling.","Joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,","Still onward; still the splendour gradual swell&apos;d.","Rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld","By jasper pillars, letting through their shafts","A blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts","Each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:","For what poor mortals fragment up, as mere","As marble was there lavish, to the vast","Of one fair palace, that far far surpass&apos;d,","Even for common bulk, those olden three,","Memphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.","","  As large, as bright, as colour&apos;d as the bow","Of Iris, when unfading it doth shew","Beyond a silvery shower, was the arch","Through which this Paphian army took its march,","Into the outer courts of Neptune&apos;s state:","Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,","To which the leaders sped; but not half raught","Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,","And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes","Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.","Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze","Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,","And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne","Of emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;","At his right hand stood winged Love, and on","His left sat smiling Beauty&apos;s paragon.","","  Far as the mariner on highest mast","Can see all round upon the calmed vast,","So wide was Neptune&apos;s hall: and as the blue","Doth vault the waters, so the waters drew","Their doming curtains, high, magnificent,","Aw&apos;d from the throne aloof;--and when storm-rent","Disclos&apos;d the thunder-gloomings in Jove&apos;s air;","But sooth&apos;d as now, flash&apos;d sudden everywhere,","Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering","Death to a human eye: for there did spring","From natural west, and east, and south, and north,","A light as of four sunsets, blazing forth","A gold-green zenith &apos;bove the Sea-God&apos;s head.","Of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread","As breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe","Of feather&apos;d Indian darts about, as through","The delicatest air: air verily,","But for the portraiture of clouds and sky:","This palace floor breath-air,--but for the amaze","Of deep-seen wonders motionless,--and blaze","Of the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,","Globing a golden sphere.","","                          They stood in dreams","Till Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;","The Nereids danc&apos;d; the Syrens faintly sang;","And the great Sea-King bow&apos;d his dripping head.","Then Love took wing, and from his pinions shed","On all the multitude a nectarous dew.","The ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew","Fair Scylla and her guides to conference;","And when they reach&apos;d the throned eminence","She kist the sea-nymph&apos;s cheek,--who sat her down","A toying with the doves. Then,--&quot;Mighty crown","And sceptre of this kingdom!&quot; Venus said,","&quot;Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:","Behold!&quot;--Two copious tear-drops instant fell","From the God&apos;s large eyes; he smil&apos;d delectable,","And over Glaucus held his blessing hands.--","&quot;Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands","Of love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour","I met thee in earth&apos;s bosom, all my power","Have I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet","Escap&apos;d from dull mortality&apos;s harsh net?","A little patience, youth! &apos;twill not be long,","Or I am skilless quite: an idle tongue,","A humid eye, and steps luxurious,","Where these are new and strange, are ominous.","Aye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,","When others were all blind; and were I given","To utter secrets, haply I might say","Some pleasant words:--but Love will have his day.","So wait awhile expectant. Pr&apos;ythee soon,","Even in the passing of thine honey-moon,","Visit my Cytherea: thou wilt find","Cupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;","And pray persuade with thee--Ah, I have done,","All blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!&quot;--","Thus the fair goddess: while Endymion","Knelt to receive those accents halcyon.","","  Meantime a glorious revelry began","Before the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran","In courteous fountains to all cups outreach&apos;d;","And plunder&apos;d vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach&apos;d","New growth about each shell and pendent lyre;","The which, in disentangling for their fire,","Pull&apos;d down fresh foliage and coverture","For dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,","Flutter&apos;d and laugh&apos;d, and oft-times through the throng","Made a delighted way. Then dance, and song,","And garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign&apos;d.","In harmless tendril they each other chain&apos;d,","And strove who should be smother&apos;d deepest in","Fresh crush of leaves.","","                          O &apos;tis a very sin","For one so weak to venture his poor verse","In such a place as this. O do not curse,","High Muses! let him hurry to the ending.","","  All suddenly were silent. A soft blending","Of dulcet instruments came charmingly;","And then a hymn.","","                    &quot;KING of the stormy sea!","Brother of Jove, and co-inheritor","Of elements! Eternally before","Thee the waves awful bow. Fast, stubborn rock,","At thy fear&apos;d trident shrinking, doth unlock","Its deep foundations, hissing into foam.","All mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home","Of thy capacious bosom ever flow.","Thou frownest, and old Eolus thy foe","Skulks to his cavern, &apos;mid the gruff complaint","Of all his rebel tempests. Dark clouds faint","When, from thy diadem, a silver gleam","Slants over blue dominion. Thy bright team","Gulphs in the morning light, and scuds along","To bring thee nearer to that golden song","Apollo singeth, while his chariot","Waits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not","For scenes like this: an empire stern hast thou;","And it hath furrow&apos;d that large front: yet now,","As newly come of heaven, dost thou sit","To blend and interknit","Subdued majesty with this glad time.","O shell-borne King sublime!","We lay our hearts before thee evermore--","We sing, and we adore!","","  &quot;Breathe softly, flutes;","Be tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;","Nor be the trumpet heard!

Still his feet","Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,","Until it reached a splashing fountain&apos;s side","That, near a cavern&apos;s mouth, for ever pour&apos;d","Unto the temperate air: then high it soar&apos;d,","And, downward, suddenly began to dip,","As if, athirst with so much toil, &apos;twould sip","The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch","Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch","Even with mealy gold the waters clear.","But, at that very touch, to disappear","So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,","Endymion sought around, and shook each bed","Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung","Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,","What whisperer disturb&apos;d his gloomy rest?","It was a nymph uprisen to the breast","In the fountain&apos;s pebbly margin, and she stood","&apos;Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.","To him her dripping hand she softly kist,","And anxiously began to plait and twist","Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: &quot;Youth!","Too long, alas, hast thou starv&apos;d on the ruth,","The bitterness of love: too long indeed,","Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed","Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer","All the bright riches of my crystal coffer","To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,","Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,","Vermilion-tail&apos;d, or finn&apos;d with silvery gauze;","Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws","A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands","Tawny and gold, ooz&apos;d slowly from far lands","By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,","My charming rod, my potent river spells;","Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup","Meander gave me,--for I bubbled up","To fainting creatures in a desert wild.","But woe is me, I am but as a child","To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,","Is, that I pity thee; that on this day","I&apos;ve been thy guide; that thou must wander far","In other regions, past the scanty bar","To mortal steps, before thou cans&apos;t be ta&apos;en","From every wasting sigh, from every pain,","Into the gentle bosom of thy love.","Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above:","But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!","I have a ditty for my hollow cell.&quot;","","  Hereat, she vanished from Endymion&apos;s gaze,","Who brooded o&apos;er the water in amaze:","The dashing fount pour&apos;d on, and where its pool","Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,","Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,","And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill","Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,","Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr","Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;","And, while beneath the evening&apos;s sleepy frown","Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,","Thus breath&apos;d he to himself: &quot;Whoso encamps","To take a fancied city of delight,","O what a wretch is he! and when &apos;tis his,","After long toil and travelling, to miss","The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:","Yet, for him there&apos;s refreshment even in toil;","Another city doth he set about,","Free from the smallest pebble-bead of doubt","That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:","Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,","And onward to another city speeds.","But this is human life: the war, the deeds,","The disappointment, the anxiety,","Imagination&apos;s struggles, far and nigh,","All human; bearing in themselves this good,","That they are sill the air, the subtle food,","To make us feel existence, and to shew","How quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,","Whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,","There is no depth to strike in: I can see","Nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand","Upon a misty, jutting head of land--","Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,","When mad Eurydice is listening to &apos;t;","I&apos;d rather stand upon this misty peak,","With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,","But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,","Than be--I care not what. O meekest dove","Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!","From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,","Glance but one little beam of temper&apos;d light","Into my bosom, that the dreadful might","And tyranny of love be somewhat scar&apos;d!","Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar&apos;d,","Would give a pang to jealous misery,","Worse than the torment&apos;s self: but rather tie","Large wings upon my shoulders, and point out","My love&apos;s far dwelling. Though the playful rout","Of Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,","Too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow","Not to have dipp&apos;d in love&apos;s most gentle stream.","O be propitious, nor severely deem","My madness impious; for, by all the stars","That tend thy bidding, I do think the bars","That kept my spirit in are burst--that I","Am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!","How beautiful thou art! The world how deep!","How tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep","Around their axle! Then these gleaming reins,","How lithe! When this thy chariot attains","Is airy goal, haply some bower veils","Those twilight eyes? Those eyes!--my spirit fails--","Dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air","Will gulph me--help!&quot;--At this with madden&apos;d stare,","And lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;","Like old Deucalion mountain&apos;d o&apos;er the flood,","Or blind Orion hungry for the morn.","And, but from the deep cavern there was borne","A voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;","Nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion&apos;d moan","Had more been heard. Thus swell&apos;d it forth: &quot;Descend,","Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend","Into the sparry hollows of the world!","Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl&apos;d","As from thy threshold, day by day hast been","A little lower than the chilly sheen","Of icy pinnacles, and dipp&apos;dst thine arms","Into the deadening ether that still charms","Their marble being: now, as deep profound","As those are high, descend! He ne&apos;er is crown&apos;d","With immortality, who fears to follow","Where airy voices lead: so through the hollow,","The silent mysteries of earth, descend!&quot;","","  He heard but the last words, nor could contend","One moment in reflection: for he fled","Into the fearful deep, to hide his head","From the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.","","  &apos;Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;","Sharpening, by degrees, his appetite","To dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,","The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,","But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;","A dusky empire and its diadems;","One faint eternal eventide of gems.","Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,","Along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,","With all its lines abrupt and angular:","Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,","Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,","Like Vulcan&apos;s rainbow, with some monstrous roof","Curves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,","It seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss","Fancy into belief: anon it leads","Through winding passages, where sameness breeds","Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;","Whether to silver grots, or giant range","Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge","Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge","Now fareth he, that o&apos;er the vast beneath","Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth","A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come","But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb","His bosom grew, when first he, far away,","Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray","Old darkness from his throne: &apos;twas like the sun","Uprisen o&apos;er chaos: and with such a stun","Came the amazement, that, absorb&apos;d in it,","He saw not fiercer wonders--past the wit","Of any spirit to tell, but one of those","Who, when this planet&apos;s sphering time doth close,","Will be its high remembrancers: who they?","The mighty ones who have made eternal day","For Greece and England. While astonishment","With deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went","Into a marble gallery, passing through","A mimic temple, so complete and true","In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear&apos;d","To search it inwards, whence far off appear&apos;d,","Through a long pillar&apos;d vista, a fair shrine,","And, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,","A quiver&apos;d Dian. Stepping awfully,","The youth approach&apos;d; oft turning his veil&apos;d eye","Down sidelong aisles, and into niches old.","And when, more near against the marble cold","He had touch&apos;d his forehead, he began to thread","All courts and passages, where silence dead","Rous&apos;d by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:","And long he travers&apos;d to and fro, to acquaint","Himself with every mystery, and awe;","Till, weary, he sat down before the maw","Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim","To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.","There, when new wonders ceas&apos;d to float before,","And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore","The journey homeward to habitual self!","A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,","Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,","Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,","Into the bosom of a hated thing.","","  What misery most drowningly doth sing","In lone Endymion&apos;s ear, now he has caught","The goal of consciousness? Ah, &apos;tis the thought,","The deadly feel of solitude: for lo!","He cannot see the heavens, nor the flow","Of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild","In pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil&apos;d,","The cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,","Like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest","Cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;","But far from such companionship to wear","An unknown time, surcharg&apos;d with grief, away,","Was now his lot. And must he patient stay,","Tracing fantastic figures with his spear?","&quot;No!&quot; exclaimed he, &quot;why should I tarry here?&quot;","No! loudly echoed times innumerable.","At which he straightway started, and &apos;gan tell","His paces back into the temple&apos;s chief;","Warming and glowing strong in the belief","Of help from Dian: so that when again","He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,","Moving more near the while. &quot;O Haunter chaste","Of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,","Where with thy silver bow and arrows keen","Art thou now forested? O woodland Queen,","What smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?","Where dost thou listen to the wide halloos","Of thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree","Glimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe&apos;er it be,","&apos;Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste","Freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste","Thy loveliness in dismal elements;","But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,","There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee","It feels Elysian, how rich to me,","An exil&apos;d mortal, sounds its pleasant name!","Within my breast there lives a choking flame--","O let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!","A homeward fever parches up my tongue--","O let me slake it at the running springs!","Upon my ear a noisy nothing rings--","O let me once more hear the linnet&apos;s note!","Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float--","O let me &apos;noint them with the heaven&apos;s light!","Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?","O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!","Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?","O think how this dry palate would rejoice!","If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,","Oh think how I should love a bed of flowers!--","Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!","Deliver me from this rapacious deep!&quot;","","  Thus ending loudly, as he would o&apos;erleap","His destiny, alert he stood: but when","Obstinate silence came heavily again,","Feeling about for its old couch of space","And airy cradle, lowly bow&apos;d his face","Desponding, o&apos;er the marble floor&apos;s cold thrill.","But &apos;twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill","To its old channel, or a swollen tide","To margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,","And flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns","Up heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns","Itself, and strives its own delights to hide--","Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride","In a long whispering birth enchanted grew","Before his footsteps; as when heav&apos;d anew","Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,","Down whose green back the short-liv&apos;d foam, all hoar,","Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.","","  Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,","Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;","So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes","One moment with his hand among the sweets:","Onward he goes--he stops--his bosom beats","As plainly in his ear, as the faint charm","Of which the throbs were born. This still alarm,","This sleepy music, forc&apos;d him walk tiptoe:","For it came more softly than the east could blow","Arion&apos;s magic to the Atlantic isles;","Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles","Of thron&apos;d Apollo, could breathe back the lyre","To seas Ionian and Tyrian.","","  O did he ever live, that lonely man,","Who lov&apos;d--and music slew not? &apos;Tis the pest","Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;","That things of delicate and tenderest worth","Are swallow&apos;d all, and made a seared dearth,","By one consuming flame: it doth immerse","And suffocate true blessings in a curse.","Half-happy, by comparison of bliss,","Is miserable. &apos;Twas even so with this","Dew-dropping melody, in the Carian&apos;s ear;","First heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,","Vanish&apos;d in elemental passion.","","  And down some swart abysm he had gone,","Had not a heavenly guide benignant led","To where thick myrtle branches, &apos;gainst his head","Brushing, awakened: then the sounds again","Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain","Over a bower, where little space he stood;","For as the sunset peeps into a wood","So saw he panting light, and towards it went","Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!","Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,","Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.","","  After a thousand mazes overgone,","At last, with sudden step, he came upon","A chamber, myrtle wall&apos;d, embowered high,","Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,","And more of beautiful and strange beside:","For on a silken couch of rosy pride,","In midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth","Of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,","Than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:","And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,","Or ripe October&apos;s faded marigolds,","Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds--","Not hiding up an Apollonian curve","Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve","Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;","But rather, giving them to the filled sight","Officiously. Sideway his face repos&apos;d","On one white arm, and tenderly unclos&apos;d,","By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth","To slumbery pout; just as the morning south","Disparts a dew-lipp&apos;d rose. Above his head,","Four lily stalks did their white honours wed","To make a coronal; and round him grew","All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,","Together intertwin&apos;d and trammel&apos;d fresh:","The vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,","Shading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,","Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;","Convolvulus in streaked vases flush;","The creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;","And virgin&apos;s bower, trailing airily;","With others of the sisterhood. Hard by,","Stood serene Cupids watching silently.","One, kneeling to a lyre, touch&apos;d the strings,","Muffling to death the pathos with his wings;","And, ever and anon, uprose to look","At the youth&apos;s slumber; while another took","A willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,","And shook it on his hair; another flew","In through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise","Rain&apos;d violets upon his sleeping eyes.","","  At these enchantments, and yet many more,","The breathless Latmian wonder&apos;d o&apos;er and o&apos;er;","Until, impatient in embarrassment,","He forthright pass&apos;d, and lightly treading went","To that same feather&apos;d lyrist, who straightway,","Smiling, thus whisper&apos;d: &quot;Though from upper day","Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here","Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!","For &apos;tis the nicest touch of human honour,","When some ethereal and high-favouring donor","Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;","As now &apos;tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence","Was I in no wise startled. So recline","Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,","Alive with sparkles--never, I aver,","Since Ariadne was a vintager,","So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,","Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears","Were high about Pomona: here is cream,","Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;","Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm&apos;d","For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm&apos;d","By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums","Ready to melt between an infant&apos;s gums:","And here is manna pick&apos;d from Syrian trees,","In starlight, by the three Hesperides.","Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know","Of all these things around us.&quot; He did so,","Still brooding o&apos;er the cadence of his lyre;","And thus: &quot;I need not any hearing tire","By telling how the sea-born goddess pin&apos;d","For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind","Him all in all unto her doting self.","Who would not be so prison&apos;d? but, fond elf,","He was content to let her amorous plea","Faint through his careless arms; content to see","An unseiz&apos;d heaven dying at his feet;","Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat,","When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,","Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born","Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes","Were clos&apos;d in sullen moisture, and quick sighs","Came vex&apos;d and pettish through her nostrils small.","Hush! no exclaim--yet, justly mightst thou call","Curses upon his head.--I was half glad,","But my poor mistress went distract and mad,","When the boar tusk&apos;d him: so away she flew","To Jove&apos;s high throne, and by her plainings drew","Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer&apos;s beard;","Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear&apos;d","Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,","That same Adonis, safe in the privacy","Of this still region all his winter-sleep.","Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep","Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower","Heal&apos;d up the wound, and, with a balmy power,","Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:","The which she fills with visions, and doth dress","In all this quiet luxury; and hath set","Us young immortals, without any let,","To watch his slumber through. &apos;Tis well nigh pass&apos;d,","Even to a moment&apos;s filling up, and fast","She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through","The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew","Embower&apos;d sports in Cytherea&apos;s isle.","Look! how those winged listeners all this while","Stand anxious: see! behold!&quot;--This clamant word","Broke through the careful silence; for they heard","A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter&apos;d","Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter&apos;d,","The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh","Lay dormant, mov&apos;d convuls&apos;d and gradually","Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum","Of sudden voices, echoing, &quot;Come! come!","Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk&apos;d","Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk&apos;d","Full soothingly to every nested finch:","Rise, Cupids! or we&apos;ll give the blue-bell pinch","To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!&quot;","At this, from every side they hurried in,","Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,","And doubling overhead their little fists","In backward yawns. But all were soon alive:","For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive","In nectar&apos;d clouds and curls through water fair,","So from the arbour roof down swell&apos;d an air","Odorous and enlivening; making all","To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call","For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green","Disparted, and far upward could be seen","Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,","Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,","Spun off a drizzling dew,--which falling chill","On soft Adonis&apos; shoulders, made him still","Nestle and turn uneasily about.","Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch&apos;d out,","And silken traces lighten&apos;d in descent;","And soon, returning from love&apos;s banishment,","Queen Venus leaning downward open arm&apos;d:","Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm&apos;d","A tumult to his heart, and a new life","Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,","But for her comforting! unhappy sight,","But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write","Of these first minutes? The unchariest muse","To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.","","  O it has ruffled every spirit there,","Saving love&apos;s self, who stands superb to share","The general gladness: awfully he stands;","A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;","No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;","His quiver is mysterious, none can know","What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes","There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:","A scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who","Look full upon it feel anon the blue","Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.","Endymion feels it, and no more controls","The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,","He had begun a plaining of his woe.","But Venus, bending forward, said: &quot;My child,","Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild","With love--he--but alas! too well I see","Thou know&apos;st the deepness of his misery.","Ah, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,","That when through heavy hours I used to rue","The endless sleep of this new-born Adon&apos;,","This stranger ay I pitied. For upon","A dreary morning once I fled away","Into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray","For this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz&apos;d","Me even to tears: thence, when a little eas&apos;d,","Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,","I saw this youth as he despairing stood:","Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind:","Those same full fringed lids a constant blind","Over his sullen eyes: I saw him throw","Himself on wither&apos;d leaves, even as though","Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov&apos;d,","Yet mutter&apos;d wildly. I could hear he lov&apos;d","Some fair immortal, and that his embrace","Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace","Of this in heaven: I have mark&apos;d each cheek,","And find it is the vainest thing to seek;","And that of all things &apos;tis kept secretest.","Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:","So still obey the guiding hand that fends","Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.","&apos;Tis a concealment needful in extreme;","And if I guess&apos;d not so, the sunny beam","Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!","Here must we leave thee.&quot;--At these words up flew","The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,","Up went the hum celestial. High afar","The Latmian saw them minish into nought;","And, when all were clear vanish&apos;d, still he caught","A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.","When all was darkened, with Etnean throe","The earth clos&apos;d--gave a solitary moan--","And left him once again in twilight lone.","","  He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,","For all those visions were o&apos;ergone, and past,","And he in loneliness: he felt assur&apos;d","Of happy times, when all he had endur&apos;d","Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.","So, with unusual gladness, on he hies","Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,","Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,","Black polish&apos;d porticos of awful shade,","And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,","Leading afar past wild magnificence,","Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence","Stretching across a void, then guiding o&apos;er","Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,","Streams subterranean tease their granite beds;","Then heighten&apos;d just above the silvery heads","Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash","The waters with his spear; but at the splash,","Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose","Sudden a poplar&apos;s height, and &apos;gan to enclose","His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round","Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,","Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells","Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells","On this delight; for, every minute&apos;s space,","The streams with changed magic interlace:","Sometimes like delicatest lattices,","Cover&apos;d with crystal vines; then weeping trees,","Moving about as in a gentle wind,","Which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin&apos;d,","Pour&apos;d into shapes of curtain&apos;d canopies,","Spangled, and rich with liquid broideries","Of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.","Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;","And then the water, into stubborn streams","Collecting, mimick&apos;d the wrought oaken beams,","Pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,","Of those dusk places in times far aloof","Cathedrals call&apos;d. He bade a loth farewel","To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,","And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,","Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,","Blackening on every side, and overhead","A vaulted dome like Heaven&apos;s, far bespread","With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,","The solitary felt a hurried change","Working within him into something dreary,--","Vex&apos;d like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,","And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.","But he revives at once: for who beholds","New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?","Forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,","Came mother Cybele! alone--alone--","In sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown","About her majesty, and front death-pale,","With turrets crown&apos;d. Four maned lions hale","The sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,","Their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws","Uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails","Cowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails","This shadowy queen athwart, and faints away","In another gloomy arch.","","                          Wherefore delay,","Young traveller, in such a mournful place?","Art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace","The diamond path? And does it indeed end","Abrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend","Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne","Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;","Abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;","To cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost","Towards him a large eagle, &apos;twixt whose wings,","Without one impious word, himself he flings,","Committed to the darkness and the gloom:","Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,","Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell","Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,","And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath&apos;d,","Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath&apos;d","So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem&apos;d","Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem&apos;d","With airs delicious. In the greenest nook","The eagle landed him, and farewel took.","","  It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown","With golden moss. His every sense had grown","Ethereal for pleasure; &apos;bove his head","Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread","Was Hesperean; to his capable ears","Silence was music from the holy spheres;","A dewy luxury was in his eyes;","The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs","And stirr&apos;d them faintly. Verdant cave and cell","He wander&apos;d through, oft wondering at such swell","Of sudden exaltation: but, &quot;Alas!","Said he, &quot;will all this gush of feeling pass","Away in solitude? And must they wane,","Like melodies upon a sandy plain,","Without an echo? Then shall I be left","So sad, so melancholy, so bereft!","Yet still I feel immortal! O my love,","My breath of life, where art thou? High above,","Dancing before the morning gates of heaven?","Or keeping watch among those starry seven,","Old Atlas&apos; children? Art a maid of the waters,","One of shell-winding Triton&apos;s bright-hair&apos;d daughters?","Or art, impossible! a nymph of Dian&apos;s,","Weaving a coronal of tender scions","For very idleness? Where&apos;er thou art,","Methinks it now is at my will to start","Into thine arms; to scare Aurora&apos;s train,","And snatch thee from the morning; o&apos;er the main","To scud like a wild bird, and take thee off","From thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff","Thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.","No, no, too eagerly my soul deceives","Its powerless self: I know this cannot be.","O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee","To her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!","Hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil","For some few hours the coming solitude.&quot;","","  Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued","With power to dream deliciously; so wound","Through a dim passage, searching till he found","The smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where","He threw himself, and just into the air","Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!","A naked waist: &quot;Fair Cupid, whence is this?&quot;","A well-known voice sigh&apos;d, &quot;Sweetest, here am I!&quot;","At which soft ravishment, with doating cry","They trembled to each other.--Helicon!","O fountain&apos;d hill! Old Homer&apos;s Helicon!","That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o&apos;er","These sorry pages; then the verse would soar","And sing above this gentle pair, like lark","Over his nested young: but all is dark","Around thine aged top, and thy clear fount","Exhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count","Of mighty Poets is made up; the scroll","Is folded by the Muses; the bright roll","Is in Apollo&apos;s hand: our dazed eyes","Have seen a new tinge in the western skies:","The world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,","Although the sun of poesy is set,","These lovers did embrace, and we must weep","That there is no old power left to steep","A quill immortal in their joyous tears.","Long time in silence did their anxious fears","Question that thus it was; long time they lay","Fondling and kissing every doubt away;","Long time ere soft caressing sobs began","To mellow into words, and then there ran","Two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.","&quot;O known Unknown! from whom my being sips","Such darling essence, wherefore may I not","Be ever in these arms? in this sweet spot","Pillow my chin for ever? ever press","These toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?","Why not for ever and for ever feel","That breath about my eyes?

Love&apos;s madness he had known:","Often with more than tortured lion&apos;s groan","Moanings had burst from him; but now that rage","Had pass&apos;d away: no longer did he wage","A rough-voic&apos;d war against the dooming stars.","No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:","The lyre of his soul Eolian tun&apos;d","Forgot all violence, and but commun&apos;d","With melancholy thought: O he had swoon&apos;d","Drunken from pleasure&apos;s nipple; and his love","Henceforth was dove-like.--Loth was he to move","From the imprinted couch, and when he did,","&apos;Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid","In muffling hands. So temper&apos;d, out he stray&apos;d","Half seeing visions that might have dismay&apos;d","Alecto&apos;s serpents; ravishments more keen","Than Hermes&apos; pipe, when anxious he did lean","Over eclipsing eyes: and at the last","It was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,","O&apos;er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,","And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,","Of every shape and size, even to the bulk","In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk","Against an endless storm. Moreover too,","Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,","Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder","Endymion sat down, and &apos;gan to ponder","On all his life: his youth, up to the day","When &apos;mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,","He stept upon his shepherd throne: the look","Of his white palace in wild forest nook,","And all the revels he had lorded there:","Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,","With every friend and fellow-woodlander--","Pass&apos;d like a dream before him. Then the spur","Of the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans","To nurse the golden age &apos;mong shepherd clans:","That wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:","His sister&apos;s sorrow; and his wanderings all,","Until into the earth&apos;s deep maw he rush&apos;d:","Then all its buried magic, till it flush&apos;d","High with excessive love. &quot;And now,&quot; thought he,","&quot;How long must I remain in jeopardy","Of blank amazements that amaze no more?","Now I have tasted her sweet soul to the core","All other depths are shallow: essences,","Once spiritual, are like muddy lees,","Meant but to fertilize my earthly root,","And make my branches lift a golden fruit","Into the bloom of heaven: other light,","Though it be quick and sharp enough to blight","The Olympian eagle&apos;s vision, is dark,","Dark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!","My silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;","Or they are but the ghosts, the dying swells","Of noises far away?--list!&quot;--Hereupon","He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone","Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,","On either side outgush&apos;d, with misty spray,","A copious spring; and both together dash&apos;d","Swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash&apos;d","Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,","Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot","Down from the ceiling&apos;s height, pouring a noise","As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize","Upon the last few steps, and with spent force","Along the ground they took a winding course.","Endymion follow&apos;d--for it seem&apos;d that one","Ever pursued, the other strove to shun--","Follow&apos;d their languid mazes, till well nigh","He had left thinking of the mystery,--","And was now rapt in tender hoverings","Over the vanish&apos;d bliss. Ah! what is it sings","His dream away? What melodies are these?","They sound as through the whispering of trees,","Not native in such barren vaults. Give ear!","","  &quot;O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear","Such tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,","Why didst thou hear her prayer?

Have ye seen his face?","Have ye beheld his chariot, foam&apos;d along","By noble winged creatures he hath made?","I saw him on the calmed waters scud,","With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,","That it enforc&apos;d me to bid sad farewell","To all my empire: farewell sad I took,","And hither came, to see how dolorous fate","Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best","Give consolation in this woe extreme.","Receive the truth, and let it be your balm.&quot;","","     Whether through pos&apos;d conviction, or disdain,","They guarded silence, when Oceanus","Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?","But so it was, none answer&apos;d for a space,","Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;","And yet she answer&apos;d not, only complain&apos;d,","With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,","Thus wording timidly among the fierce:","&quot;O Father! I am here the simplest voice,","And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,","And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,","There to remain for ever, as I fear:","I would not bode of evil, if I thought","So weak a creature could turn off the help","Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;","Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell","Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,","And know that we had parted from all hope.","I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,","Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land","Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.","Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;","Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;","So that I felt a movement in my heart","To chide, and to reproach that solitude","With songs of misery, music of our woes;","And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell","And murmur&apos;d into it, and made melody---","O melody no more! for while I sang,","And with poor skill let pass into the breeze","The dull shell&apos;s echo, from a bowery strand","Just opposite, an island of the sea,","There came enchantment with the shifting wind,","That did both drown and keep alive my ears.","I threw my shell away upon the sand,","And a wave fill&apos;d it, as my sense was fill&apos;d","With that new blissful golden melody.","A living death was in each gush of sounds,","Each family of rapturous hurried notes,","That fell, one after one, yet all at once,","Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:","And then another, then another strain,","Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,","With music wing&apos;d instead of silent plumes,","To hover round my head, and make me sick","Of joy and grief at once.  Grief overcame,","And I was stopping up my frantic ears,","When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,","A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,","And still it cried, &apos;Apollo! young Apollo!","The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!&apos;","I fled, it follow&apos;d me, and cried &apos;Apollo!&apos;","O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt","Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,","Ye would not call this too indulged tongue","Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard.&quot;","","     So far her voice flow&apos;d on, like timorous brook","That, lingering along a pebbled coast,","Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,","And shudder&apos;d; for the overwhelming voice","Of huge Enceladus swallow&apos;d it in wrath:","The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves","In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,","Came booming thus, while still upon his arm","He lean&apos;d; not rising, from supreme contempt.","&quot;Or shall we listen to the over-wise,","Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?","Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all","That rebel Jove&apos;s whole armoury were spent,","Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,","Could agonize me more than baby-words","In midst of this dethronement horrible.","Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.","Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?","Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?","Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the waves,","Thy scalding in the seas?  What! have I rous&apos;d","Your spleens with so few simple words as these?","O joy! for now I see ye are not lost:","O joy! for now I see a thousand eyes","Wide-glaring for revenge!&quot;---As this he said,","He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,","Still without intermission speaking thus:","&quot;Now ye are flames, I&apos;ll tell you how to burn,","And purge the ether of our enemies;","How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,","And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,","Stifling that puny essence in its tent.","O let him feel the evil he hath done;","For though I scorn Oceanus&apos;s lore,","Much pain have I for more than loss of realms:","The days of peace and slumbrous calm are fled;","Those days, all innocent of scathing war,","When all the fair Existences of heaven","Carne open-eyed to guess what we would speak:---","That was before our brows were taught to frown,","Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;","That was before we knew the winged thing,","Victory, might be lost, or might be won.","And be ye mindful that Hyperion,","Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced---","Hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!&quot;","","     All eyes were on Enceladus&apos;s face,","And they beheld, while still Hyperion&apos;s name","Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,","A pallid gleam across his features stern:","Not savage, for he saw full many a God","Wroth as himself.  He look&apos;d upon them all,","And in each face he saw a gleam of light,","But splendider in Saturn&apos;s, whose hoar locks","Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel","When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.","In pale and silver silence they remain&apos;d,","Till suddenly a splendor, like the morn,","Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,","All the sad spaces of oblivion,","And every gulf, and every chasm old,","And every height, and every sullen depth,","Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:","And all the everlasting cataracts,","And all the headlong torrents far and near,","Mantled before in darkness and huge shade,","Now saw the light and made it terrible.","It was Hyperion:---a granite peak","His bright feet touch&apos;d, and there he stay&apos;d to view","The misery his brilliance had betray&apos;d","To the most hateful seeing of itself.","Golden his hair of short Numidian curl,","Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade","In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk","Of Memnon&apos;s image at the set of sun","To one who travels from the dusking East:","Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon&apos;s harp","He utter&apos;d, while his hands contemplative","He press&apos;d together, and in silence stood.","Despondence seiz&apos;d again the fallen Gods","At sight of the dejected King of day,","And many hid their faces from the light:","But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes","Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,","Uprose Iapetus, and Creus too,","And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode","To where he towered on his eminence.","There those four shouted forth old Saturn&apos;s name;","Hyperion from the peak loud answered, &quot;Saturn!&quot;","Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,","In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods","Gave from their hollow throats the name of &quot;Saturn!&quot;","","","BOOK III","THUS in altemate uproar and sad peace,","Amazed were those Titans utterly.","O leave them, Muse!

No howling sad","Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had","Great bounty from Endymion our lord.","The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour&apos;d","His early song against yon breezy sky,","That spreads so clear o&apos;er our solemnity.&quot;","","  Thus ending, on the shrine he heap&apos;d a spire","Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;","Anon he stain&apos;d the thick and spongy sod","With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.","Now while the earth was drinking it, and while","Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,","And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright","&apos;Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light","Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:","","  &quot;O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang","From jagged trunks, and overshadoweth","Eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death","Of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;","Who lov&apos;st to see the hamadryads dress","Their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;","And through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken","The dreary melody of bedded reeds--","In desolate places, where dank moisture breeds","The pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;","Bethinking thee, how melancholy loth","Thou wast to lose fair Syrinx--do thou now,","By thy love&apos;s milky brow!","By all the trembling mazes that she ran,","Hear us, great Pan!","","  &quot;O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles","Passion their voices cooingly &apos;mong myrtles,","What time thou wanderest at eventide","Through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side","Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom","Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom","Their ripen&apos;d fruitage; yellow girted bees","Their golden honeycombs; our village leas","Their fairest-blossom&apos;d beans and poppied corn;","The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,","To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries","Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies","Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year","All its completions--be quickly near,","By every wind that nods the mountain pine,","O forester divine!","","  &quot;Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies","For willing service; whether to surprise","The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;","Or upward ragged precipices flit","To save poor lambkins from the eagle&apos;s maw;","Or by mysterious enticement draw","Bewildered shepherds to their path again;","Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,","And gather up all fancifullest shells","For thee to tumble into Naiads&apos; cells,","And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;","Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,","The while they pelt each other on the crown","With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown--","By all the echoes that about thee ring,","Hear us, O satyr king!","","  &quot;O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,","While ever and anon to his shorn peers","A ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,","When snouted wild-boars routing tender corn","Anger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,","To keep off mildews, and all weather harms:","Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,","That come a swooning over hollow grounds,","And wither drearily on barren moors:","Dread opener of the mysterious doors","Leading to universal knowledge--see,","Great son of Dryope,","The many that are come to pay their vows","With leaves about their brows!","","  Be still the unimaginable lodge","For solitary thinkings; such as dodge","Conception to the very bourne of heaven,","Then leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,","That spreading in this dull and clodded earth","Gives it a touch ethereal--a new birth:","Be still a symbol of immensity;","A firmament reflected in a sea;","An element filling the space between;","An unknown--but no more: we humbly screen","With uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,","And giving out a shout most heaven rending,","Conjure thee to receive our humble Paean,","Upon thy Mount Lycean!","","  Even while they brought the burden to a close,","A shout from the whole multitude arose,","That lingered in the air like dying rolls","Of abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals","Of dolphins bob their noses through the brine.","Meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,","Young companies nimbly began dancing","To the swift treble pipe, and humming string.","Aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly","To tunes forgotten--out of memory:","Fair creatures! whose young children&apos;s children bred","Thermopyl&#xE6; its heroes--not yet dead,","But in old marbles ever beautiful.","High genitors, unconscious did they cull","Time&apos;s sweet first-fruits--they danc&apos;d to weariness,","And then in quiet circles did they press","The hillock turf, and caught the latter end","Of some strange history, potent to send","A young mind from its bodily tenement.","Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent","On either side; pitying the sad death","Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath","Of Zephyr slew him,--Zephyr penitent,","Who now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,","Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.","The archers too, upon a wider plain,","Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,","And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft","Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,","Call&apos;d up a thousand thoughts to envelope","Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee","And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,","Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young","Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue","Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,","And very, very deadliness did nip","Her motherly cheeks. Arous&apos;d from this sad mood","By one, who at a distance loud halloo&apos;d,","Uplifting his strong bow into the air,","Many might after brighter visions stare:","After the Argonauts, in blind amaze","Tossing about on Neptune&apos;s restless ways,","Until, from the horizon&apos;s vaulted side,","There shot a golden splendour far and wide,","Spangling those million poutings of the brine","With quivering ore: &apos;twas even an awful shine","From the exaltation of Apollo&apos;s bow;","A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.","Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,","Might turn their steps towards the sober ring","Where sat Endymion and the aged priest","&apos;Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas&apos;d","The silvery setting of their mortal star.","There they discours&apos;d upon the fragile bar","That keeps us from our homes ethereal;","And what our duties there: to nightly call","Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;","To summon all the downiest clouds together","For the sun&apos;s purple couch; to emulate","In ministring the potent rule of fate","With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;","To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons","Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,","A world of other unguess&apos;d offices.","Anon they wander&apos;d, by divine converse,","Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse","Each one his own anticipated bliss.","One felt heart-certain that he could not miss","His quick gone love, among fair blossom&apos;d boughs,","Where every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows","Her lips with music for the welcoming.","Another wish&apos;d, mid that eternal spring,","To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,","Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:","Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,","And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;","And, ever after, through those regions be","His messenger, his little Mercury.","Some were athirst in soul to see again","Their fellow huntsmen o&apos;er the wide champaign","In times long past; to sit with them, and talk","Of all the chances in their earthly walk;","Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores","Of happiness, to when upon the moors,","Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,","And shar&apos;d their famish&apos;d scrips. Thus all out-told","Their fond imaginations,--saving him","Whose eyelids curtain&apos;d up their jewels dim,","Endymion: yet hourly had he striven","To hide the cankering venom, that had riven","His fainting recollections. Now indeed","His senses had swoon&apos;d off: he did not heed","The sudden silence, or the whispers low,","Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,","Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,","Or maiden&apos;s sigh, that grief itself embalms:","But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,","Like one who on the earth had never stept.","Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,","Frozen in that old tale Arabian.","","  Who whispers him so pantingly and close?","Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,","His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,","And breath&apos;d a sister&apos;s sorrow to persuade","A yielding up, a cradling on her care.","Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:","She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse","Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,","Along a path between two little streams,--","Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,","From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow","From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;","Until they came to where these streamlets fall,","With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,","Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush","With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.","A little shallop, floating there hard by,","Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;","And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,","And dipt again, with the young couple&apos;s weight,--","Peona guiding, through the water straight,","Towards a bowery island opposite;","Which gaining presently, she steered light","Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,","Where nested was an arbour, overwove","By many a summer&apos;s silent fingering;","To whose cool bosom she was used to bring","Her playmates, with their needle broidery,","And minstrel memories of times gone by.","","  So she was gently glad to see him laid","Under her favourite bower&apos;s quiet shade,","On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,","Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves","When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,","And the tann&apos;d harvesters rich armfuls took.","Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:","But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest","Peona&apos;s busy hand against his lips,","And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips","In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps","A patient watch over the stream that creeps","Windingly by it, so the quiet maid","Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade","Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling","Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling","Among seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.","","  O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,","That broodest o&apos;er the troubled sea of the mind","Till it is hush&apos;d and smooth! O unconfin&apos;d","Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key","To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,","Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,","Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves","And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world","Of silvery enchantment!--who, upfurl&apos;d","Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,","But renovates and lives?--Thus, in the bower,","Endymion was calm&apos;d to life again.","Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,","He said: &quot;I feel this thine endearing love","All through my bosom: thou art as a dove","Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings","About me; and the pearliest dew not brings","Such morning incense from the fields of May,","As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray","From those kind eyes,--the very home and haunt","Of sisterly affection. Can I want","Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?","Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears","That, any longer, I will pass my days","Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise","My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more","Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:","Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll","Around the breathed boar: again I&apos;ll poll","The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:","And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,","Again I&apos;ll linger in a sloping mead","To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed","Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,","And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat","My soul to keep in its resolved course.&quot;","","  Hereat Peona, in their silver source,","Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,","And took a lute, from which there pulsing came","A lively prelude, fashioning the way","In which her voice should wander. &apos;Twas a lay","More subtle cadenced, more forest wild","Than Dryope&apos;s lone lulling of her child;","And nothing since has floated in the air","So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare","Went, spiritual, through the damsel&apos;s hand;","For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann&apos;d","The quick invisible strings, even though she saw","Endymion&apos;s spirit melt away and thaw","Before the deep intoxication.","But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon","Her self-possession--swung the lute aside,","And earnestly said: &quot;Brother, &apos;tis vain to hide","That thou dost know of things mysterious,","Immortal, starry; such alone could thus","Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn&apos;d in aught","Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught","A Paphian dove upon a message sent?","Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,","Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen","Her naked limbs among the alders green;","And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace","Something more high perplexing in thy face!&quot;","","  Endymion look&apos;d at her, and press&apos;d her hand,","And said, &quot;Art thou so pale, who wast so bland","And merry in our meadows? How is this?","Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!--","Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change","Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?","Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?","Ambition is no sluggard: &apos;tis no prize,","That toiling years would put within my grasp,","That I have sigh&apos;d for: with so deadly gasp","No man e&apos;er panted for a mortal love.","So all have set my heavier grief above","These things which happen. Rightly have they done:","I, who still saw the horizontal sun","Heave his broad shoulder o&apos;er the edge of the world,","Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl&apos;d","My spear aloft, as signal for the chace--","I, who, for very sport of heart, would race","With my own steed from Araby; pluck down","A vulture from his towery perching; frown","A lion into growling, loth retire--","To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,","And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast","Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest.","","  &quot;This river does not see the naked sky,","Till it begins to progress silverly","Around the western border of the wood,","Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood","Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:","And in that nook, the very pride of June,","Had I been used to pass my weary eves;","The rather for the sun unwilling leaves","So dear a picture of his sovereign power,","And I could witness his most kingly hour,","When he doth lighten up the golden reins,","And paces leisurely down amber plains","His snorting four. Now when his chariot last","Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,","There blossom&apos;d suddenly a magic bed","Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:","At which I wondered greatly, knowing well","That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;","And, sitting down close by, began to muse","What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,","In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;","Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook","Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,","Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth","Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,","Until my head was dizzy and distraught.","Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole","A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;","And shaping visions all about my sight","Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;","The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,","And then were gulph&apos;d in a tumultuous swim:","And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell","The enchantment that afterwards befel?","Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream","That never tongue, although it overteem","With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,","Could figure out and to conception bring","All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay","Watching the zenith, where the milky way","Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;","And travelling my eye, until the doors","Of heaven appear&apos;d to open for my flight,","I became loth and fearful to alight","From such high soaring by a downward glance:","So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,","Spreading imaginary pinions wide.","When, presently, the stars began to glide,","And faint away, before my eager view:","At which I sigh&apos;d that I could not pursue,","And dropt my vision to the horizon&apos;s verge;","And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge","The loveliest moon, that ever silver&apos;d o&apos;er","A shell for Neptune&apos;s goblet: she did soar","So passionately bright, my dazzled soul","Commingling with her argent spheres did roll","Through clear and cloudy, even when she went","At last into a dark and vapoury tent--","Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train","Of planets all were in the blue again.","To commune with those orbs, once more I rais&apos;d","My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed","By a bright something, sailing down apace,","Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:","Again I look&apos;d, and, O ye deities,","Who from Olympus watch our destinies!","Whence that completed form of all completeness?","Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?","Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where","Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?","Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;","Not--thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun","Such follying before thee--yet she had,","Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;","And they were simply gordian&apos;d up and braided,","Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,","Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;","The which were blended in, I know not how,","With such a paradise of lips and eyes,","Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,","That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings","And plays about its fancy, till the stings","Of human neighbourhood envenom all.","Unto what awful power shall I call?","To what high fane?--Ah! see her hovering feet,","More bluely vein&apos;d, more soft, more whitely sweet","Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose","From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows","Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;","&apos;Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million","Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,","Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,","Handfuls of daisies.&quot;--&quot;Endymion, how strange!","Dream within dream!&quot;--&quot;She took an airy range,","And then, towards me, like a very maid,","Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,","And press&apos;d me by the hand: Ah! &apos;twas too much;","Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,","Yet held my recollection, even as one","Who dives three fathoms where the waters run","Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,","I felt upmounted in that region","Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,","And eagles struggle with the buffeting north","That balances the heavy meteor-stone;--","Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,","But lapp&apos;d and lull&apos;d along the dangerous sky.","Soon, as it seem&apos;d, we left our journeying high,","And straightway into frightful eddies swoop&apos;d;","Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop&apos;d","Huge dens and caverns in a mountain&apos;s side:","There hollow sounds arous&apos;d me, and I sigh&apos;d","To faint once more by looking on my bliss--","I was distracted; madly did I kiss","The wooing arms which held me, and did give","My eyes at once to death: but &apos;twas to live,","To take in draughts of life from the gold fount","Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count","The moments, by some greedy help that seem&apos;d","A second self, that each might be redeem&apos;d","And plunder&apos;d of its load of blessedness.","Ah, desperate mortal! I ev&apos;n dar&apos;d to press","Her very cheek against my crowned lip,","And, at that moment, felt my body dip","Into a warmer air: a moment more,","Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store","Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes","A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,","Loiter&apos;d around us; then of honey cells,","Made delicate from all white-flower bells;","And once, above the edges of our nest,","An arch face peep&apos;d,--an Oread as I guess&apos;d.","","  &quot;Why did I dream that sleep o&apos;er-power&apos;d me","In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,","Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,","And stare them from me? But no, like a spark","That needs must die, although its little beam","Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream","Fell into nothing--into stupid sleep.","And so it was, until a gentle creep,","A careful moving caught my waking ears,","And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,","My clenched hands;--for lo! the poppies hung","Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung","A heavy ditty, and the sullen day","Had chidden herald Hesperus away,","With leaden looks: the solitary breeze","Bluster&apos;d, and slept, and its wild self did teaze","With wayward melancholy; and r thought,","Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought","Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!--","Away I wander&apos;d--all the pleasant hues","Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades","Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades","Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills","Seem&apos;d sooty, and o&apos;er-spread with upturn&apos;d gills","Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown","In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown","Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird","Before my heedless footsteps stirr&apos;d, and stirr&apos;d","In little journeys, I beheld in it","A disguis&apos;d demon, missioned to knit","My soul with under darkness; to entice","My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:","Therefore I eager followed, and did curse","The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,","Rock&apos;d me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!","These things, with all their comfortings, are given","To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,","Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea","Of weary life.&quot;","","                  Thus ended he, and both","Sat silent: for the maid was very loth","To answer; feeling well that breathed words","Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords","Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps","Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,","And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;","To put on such a look as would say, Shame","On this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,","She could as soon have crush&apos;d away the life","From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,","She said with trembling chance: &quot;Is this the cause?","This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!","That one who through this middle earth should pass","Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave","His name upon the harp-string, should achieve","No higher bard than simple maidenhood,","Singing alone, and fearfully,--how the blood","Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray","He knew not where; and how he would say, nay,","If any said &apos;twas love: and yet &apos;twas love;","What could it be but love? How a ring-dove","Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;","And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,","The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;","And then the ballad of his sad life closes","With sighs, and an alas!--Endymion!","Be rather in the trumpet&apos;s mouth,--anon","Among the winds at large--that all may hearken!","Although, before the crystal heavens darken,","I watch and dote upon the silver lakes","Pictur&apos;d in western cloudiness, that takes","The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,","Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands","With horses prancing o&apos;er them, palaces","And towers of amethyst,--would I so tease","My pleasant days, because I could not mount","Into those regions? The Morphean fount","Of that fine element that visions, dreams,","And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams","Into its airy channels with so subtle,","So thin a breathing, not the spider&apos;s shuttle,","Circled a million times within the space","Of a swallow&apos;s nest-door, could delay a trace,","A tinting of its quality: how light","Must dreams themselves be; seeing they&apos;re more slight","Than the mere nothing that engenders them!","Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem","Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?","Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick","For nothing but a dream?&quot; Hereat the youth","Look&apos;d up: a conflicting of shame and ruth","Was in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids","Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids","A little breeze to creep between the fans","Of careless butterflies: amid his pains","He seem&apos;d to taste a drop of manna-dew,","Full palatable; and a colour grew","Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.","","  &quot;Peona! ever have I long&apos;d to slake","My thirst for the world&apos;s praises: nothing base,","No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace","The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar&apos;d--","Though now &apos;tis tatter&apos;d; leaving my bark bar&apos;d","And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope","Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,","To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.","Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks","Our ready minds to fellowship divine,","A fellowship with essence; till we shine,","Full alchemiz&apos;d, and free of space. Behold","The clear religion of heaven! Fold","A rose leaf round thy finger&apos;s taperness,","And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress","Of music&apos;s kiss impregnates the free winds,","And with a sympathetic touch unbinds","Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:","Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;","Old ditties sigh above their father&apos;s grave;","Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave","Round every spot where trod Apollo&apos;s foot;","Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,","Where long ago a giant battle was;","And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass","In every place where infant Orpheus slept.","Feel we these things?--that moment have we stept","Into a sort of oneness, and our state","Is like a floating spirit&apos;s. But there are","Richer entanglements, enthralments far","More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,","To the chief intensity: the crown of these","Is made of love and friendship, and sits high","Upon the forehead of humanity.","All its more ponderous and bulky worth","Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth","A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,","There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop","Of light, and that is love: its influence,","Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,","At which we start and fret; till in the end,","Melting into its radiance, we blend,","Mingle, and so become a part of it,--","Nor with aught else can our souls interknit","So wingedly: when we combine therewith,","Life&apos;s self is nourish&apos;d by its proper pith,","And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.","Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,","That men, who might have tower&apos;d in the van","Of all the congregated world, to fan","And winnow from the coming step of time","All chaff of custom, wipe away all slime","Left by men-slugs and human serpentry,","Have been content to let occasion die,","Whilst they did sleep in love&apos;s elysium.","And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,","Than speak against this ardent listlessness:","For I have ever thought that it might bless","The world with benefits unknowingly;","As does the nightingale, upperched high,","And cloister&apos;d among cool and bunched leaves--","She sings but to her love, nor e&apos;er conceives","How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.","Just so may love, although &apos;tis understood","The mere commingling of passionate breath,","Produce more than our searching witnesseth:","What I know not: but who, of men, can tell","That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell","To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,","The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,","The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,","The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,","Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,","If human souls did never kiss and greet?","","  &quot;Now, if this earthly love has power to make","Men&apos;s being mortal, immortal; to shake","Ambition from their memories, and brim","Their measure of content; what merest whim,","Seems all this poor endeavour after fame,","To one, who keeps within his stedfast aim","A love immortal, an immortal too.","Look not so wilder&apos;d; for these things are true,","And never can be born of atomies","That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,","Leaving us fancy-sick.

Overhead,","Hung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread","Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph&apos;s home.","&quot;Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?&quot;","Said I, low voic&apos;d: &quot;Ah whither! &apos;Tis the grot","Of Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,","Doth her resign; and where her tender hands","She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:","Or &apos;tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,","And babbles thorough silence, till her wits","Are gone in tender madness, and anon,","Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone","Of sadness.
